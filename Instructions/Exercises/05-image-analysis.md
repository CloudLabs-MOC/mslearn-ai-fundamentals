# Analyze images in Azure AI Foundry portal

**Azure AI Vision** includes numerous capabilities for understanding image content and context and extracting information from images. In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Vision in Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to analyze images using the built-in try-it-out experiences. 

Suppose the fictitious retailer *Northwind Traders* has decided to implement a "smart store", in which AI services monitor the store to identify customers requiring assistance, and direct employees to help them. By using Azure AI Vision, images taken by cameras throughout the store can be analyzed to provide meaningful descriptions of what they depict.

## Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal

Let's start by creating an Azure AI Foundry project.

1. In a web browser, open the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com) at `https://ai.azure.com` and sign in using your Azure credentials. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it's open):

    ![Screenshot of Azure AI Foundry home page with create an agent selected.](./media/azure-ai-foundry-home-page.png)

1. In the home page, select **+ Create an agent**.

1. In the **Create an agent** wizard, enter a valid name for your project. 

1. Select **Advanced options** and specify the following settings:
    - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: *Keep the default name*
    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*
    - **Resource group**: *Create or select a resource group*
    - **Region**: Select one of the following locations:
        * East US
        * France Central
        * Korea Central
        * West Europe
        * West US

1. Select **Create** and review your configuration. Wait for the set up process to complete.

    >**Note**: If you receive a permissions error, select the **Fix it** button to add the appropriate permissions to continue.

1. When your project is created, you will be brought by default to the Agents playfround in Azure AI Foundry portal, which should look similar to the following image:

    ![Screenshot of a Azure AI project details in Azure AI Foundry portal.](./media/ai-foundry-project-2.png)
 
1. In a new browser window, open the [Azure AI services exploration page](https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices).

1. On the *AI Services* page, select the *Vision + Document* tile to try out Azure AI Vision and Document capabilities.

## Generate captions for an image

Let's use the image captioning functionality of Azure AI Vision to analyze images taken by a camera in the *Northwind Traders* store. Image captions are available through the **Caption** and **Dense Captions** features.

1. On the *Vision + Document* page, scroll down and select **Image** under *View all other vision capabilities*. Then select the **Image captioning** tile.

    ![Screenshot of the image captioning tile in the image section of the Vision and Document page.](./media/vision-image-captioning-tile.png)

1. On the **Add captions to images** page, review the resource you are connected to which is listed under the **Try It Out** subheading. You should not have to make changes.

> **Note**: If you did not customize a valid resource location earlier during resource creation, you may be asked to create a new Azure AI services resource that is in a valid region. You will need to create the new resource to continue with the lab.

1. Download **image-analysis.zip** by opening the URL `https://aka.ms/mslearn-images-for-analysis` in a new browser tab. Using the URL should automatically download a folder on your computer. Open the folder by navigating to the *Downloads* on your computer. Then locate the file named **store-camera-1.jpg**; which contains the following image:

    ![An image of a parent using a cellphone camera to take a picture of a child in in a store](./media/analyze-images-vision/store-camera-1.jpg)

1. Upload the **store-camera-1.jpg** image by dragging it to the **Drag and drop files here** box, or by browsing to it on your file system.

1. Observe the generated caption text, visible in the **Detected attributes** panel to the right of the image.

    The **Caption** functionality provides a single, human-readable English sentence describing the image's content.

1. Next, use the same image to perform **Dense captioning**. Return to the **Vision + Document** page by selecting the *back* arrow at the top of the page. On the *Vision + Document* page, select the **Image** tab, then select the **Dense captioning** tile.

    The **Dense Captions** feature differs from the **Caption** capability in that it provides multiple human-readable captions for an image, one describing the image's content and others, each covering the essential objects detected in the picture. Each detected object includes a bounding box, which defines the pixel coordinates within the image associated with the object.

1. Hover over one of the captions in the **Detected** attributes list and observe what happens within the image.

    ![The image and its captions are displayed.](./media/analyze-images-vision/dense-captioning.png)

    Move your mouse cursor over the other captions in the list, and notice how the bounding box shifts in the image to highlight the portion of the image used to generate the caption.

## Tagging images 

The next feature you will try is the *Extract Tags* functionality. Extract tags is based on thousands of recognizable objects, including living beings, scenery, and actions.

1. Return to the *Vision + Document* page of Azure AI Foundry, then select the **Image** tab, and select the **Common tag extraction** tile.

1. Open the folder containing the images you downloaded and locate the file named **store-image-2.jpg**, which looks like this:

    ![An image of person with a shopping basket in a supermarket](./media/analyze-images-vision/store-camera-2.jpg)

1. Upload the **store-camera-2.jpg** file.

1. Review the list of tags extracted from the image and the confidence score for each in the detected attributes panel. Here the confidence score is the likelihood that the text for the detected attribute describes what is actually in the image. Notice in the list of tags that it includes not only objects, but actions, such as *shopping*, *selling*, and *standing*.

## Object detection

In this task, you use the **Object detection** feature of Image Analysis. Object detection detects and extracts bounding boxes based on thousands of recognizable objects and living beings.

1. Return to the *Vision + Document* page of Azure AI Foundry, then select the **Image** tab, and select the **Common object detection** tile.

1. Open the folder containing the images you downloaded and locate the file named **store-camera-3.jpg**, which looks like this:

    ![An image of person with a shopping cart](./media/analyze-images-vision/store-camera-3.jpg)

1. Upload the **store-camera-3.jpg** file.

1. In the **Detected attributes** box, observe the list of detected objects and their confidence scores.

1. Hover your mouse cursor over the objects in the **Detected attributes** list to highlight the object's bounding box in the image.

1. Move the **Threshold value** slider until a value of 70 is displayed to the right of the slider. Observe what happens to the objects in the list. The threshold slider specifies that only objects identified with a confidence score or probability greater than the threshold should be displayed.

## Clean up

If you donâ€™t intend to do more exercises, delete any resources that you no longer need. This avoids accruing any unnecessary costs.

1.	Open the [Azure portal]( https://portal.azure.com) and select the resource group that contains the resources you created. 
1.	Select the resource and select **Delete** and then **Yes** to confirm. The resource is then deleted.
