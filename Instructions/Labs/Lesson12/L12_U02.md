L12 Lesson Plan: Building and Optimizing a Smart Farm
Lesson Description:
In this culminating lesson, students will bring together all they’ve learned in the agriculture unit to build and optimize a smart mini farm using Arduino. Using moisture, light, and temperature sensors, students will collect data from their farms and analyze it using skills developed in Lessons 3–11. They will evaluate their system’s performance, modify it by adding additional sensors, update the code, and collect new data to compare outcomes.  

This project allows students to engage in real-world engineering and data science practices, reinforcing their understanding of structured/unstructured data, hardware/software systems, data types, and machine learning concepts.

Main Learning Goal:
Students will use previously learned skills to design, build, analyze, and improve a smart farm using Arduino and sensors.

Essential Question:

Standards:
•	IAI.A2.3: Identify and define the function of circuits, sensors, microcontrollers, motors, and other components used within given AI solutions. 
•	IAI.C3.1 Identify and use appropriate documentation methods while developing programs (e.g., inline comments, procedure header, purposeful naming)

Objectives:
•	Apply previously learned data collection, storage, and analysis skills using real-time sensor data. 
•	Build a smart farm prototype using Arduino and environmental sensors. 
•	Evaluate collected sensor data to identify trends and patterns.

a.	Note: this is the group students will work with for their final project.

Students should list at minimum temperature, soil moisture, and light levels.
c.	Q2: What actions could we take based on that data? For example: if the soil is too dry, should something turn on? If it’s too hot, what could the system do?  
We will be turning on warning lights, but students can come up with other ideas as well.
d.	Q3: Which Arduino components will we need?  
We will be using soil moisture sensors, temperature probes, photodiodes, and LEDs.
