# Lab Scenario Preview: Module 05: Read text in Vision Studio

## Lab overview

In this exercise you'll use Azure AI service to explore the optical character recognition capabilities of Azure AI Vision. You'll use Vision Studio to experiment with extracting text from images, without having to write any code.

A common computer vision challenge is to detect and interpret text embedded within an image. This is known as optical character recognition (OCR). In this exercise youâ€™ll use an Azure AI services resource, which includes Azure AI Vision services. You'll then use Vision Studio to try out OCR with different types of images.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:

- Creating an *Azure AI Speech* resource
- Connect your Azure AI service resource to Vision Studio
- Extract text from images in the Vision Studio

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes
