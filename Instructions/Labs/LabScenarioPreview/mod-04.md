# Module 04: Detect faces in Vision Studio

## Lab overview

Vision solutions often require AI to be able to detect human faces. Suppose the fictitious retail company Northwind Traders wants to locate where customers are standing in a store to best assist them. One way to accomplish this is to determine if there are any faces in the images, and if so, to return the bounding box coordinates that show their location.

To test the face detection capabilities of the Azure AI Face service, you will use [Azure Vision Studio](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/). This is a UI-based platform that lets you explore Azure AI Vision features without needing to write any code.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform:
- Create an Azure AI services resource
- Connect Azure AI Service Resource to Vision Studio
- Detect faces in the Vision Studio
 
## Estimated timing: 30 minutes
