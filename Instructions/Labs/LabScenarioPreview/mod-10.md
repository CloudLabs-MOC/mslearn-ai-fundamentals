# Lab Scenario Preview: Module 10: Extract form data in Document Intelligence Studio

## Lab overview
 
In this exercise, you'll take a look at a prebuilt model in Document Intelligence that is trained to recognize data for receipts. Azure AI Document Intelligence is able to analyze and extract information from forms and documents, then identify field names and data. 

How does Document Intelligence build upon optical character recognition (OCR)? While OCR can read printed or handwritten documents, OCR extracts text in an unstructured format which is difficult to store in a database or analyze. Document intelligence makes sense of the unstructured data by capturing the structure of the text, such as key/value pairs and information in tables. 

> **NOTE**
> Azure AI Document Intelligence is the new name for Azure Form Recognizer. You may still see Azure Form Recognizer in the Azure portal or Document Intelligence Studio.
