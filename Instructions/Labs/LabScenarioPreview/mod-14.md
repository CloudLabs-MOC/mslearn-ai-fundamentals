# Lab Scenario Preview: Module 14: Explore content filters in Azure OpenAI

## Lab overview

In this exercise you'll explore the affect of the default content filters in Azure OpenAI.
Azure OpenAI includes default content filters to help ensure that potentially harmful prompts and completions are identified and removed from interactions with the service. Additionally, you can apply for permission to define custom content filters for your specific needs to ensure your model deployments enforce the appropriate responsible AI principals for your generative AI scenario. Content filtering is one element of an effective approach to responsible AI when working with generative AI models.

## Lab objectives

- Provision an Azure OpenAI resource
