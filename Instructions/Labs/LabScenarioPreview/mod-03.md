# Lab Scenario Preview: Module 03:  Analyze images in Vision Studio  

## Lab overview

**Azure AI Vision** includes numerous capabilities for understanding image content and context and extracting information from images. Azure AI Vision Studio allows you to try out many of the capabilities of image analysis. 

In this exercise, you will use Vision Studio to analyze images using the built-in try-it-out experiences. Suppose the fictitious retailer *Northwind Traders* has decided to implement a "smart store", in which AI services monitor the store to identify customers requiring assistance, and direct employees to help them. By using Azure AI Vision, images taken by cameras throughout the store can be analyzed to provide meaningful descriptions of what they depict

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform:
  - Create an *Azure AI services* resource
  - Connect Azure AI Service Resource to Vision Studio
  - Image Analysis with Azure AI Vision Services

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes
