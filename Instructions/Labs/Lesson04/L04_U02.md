## L4 Lesson Plan: Data Storage and Organization  
### Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore how farmers store and organize agricultural data for better decision-making. They will compare traditional vs. modern data storage methods, learn about data types, practice sorting and filtering in Google Sheets, and understand how structured data helps in AI applications. Hands-on activities will allow students to create and clean datasets.   

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will understand how agricultural data is collected, stored, and organized using modern tools like spreadsheets and databases.   

### Essential Question:
How does data organization improve agricultural decision-making?  

### Standards:
•	IAI.B1.4 Describe the various data storage tools and data organization methods related to generated lists and 2D arrays.
Objectives:
•	Compare traditional vs. modern agricultural data storage methods  
•	Organize data into structured formats for better decision-making  
•	Perform sorting, filtering, and data cleaning in Google Sheets  
•	Export datasets into AI-ready formats


### Total Duration: ~120 minutes (2 days)

### Engage (Elicit/Develop) ~ 10 minutes

#### Activity #1: How Do Farmers Store Data? (~10 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1.	The teacher will introduce the lesson by briefly describing information farmers collect and organize data. They will then facilitate a warm-up discussion, and students will write their guesses on the board.

a.	Q1: Where do you think farmers store their data?

•	Old School (Traditional Methods): Farmers wrote everything down in logs or notebooks

•	Modern Methods: Tools such as Google Sheets, databases, or cloud storage to help find patterns and make decisions quicker. 

2.	The teacher will continue explaining the importance of data organization and relating it to farmers and agriculture.


#### Activity #2: Creating a Sample Dataset (~25 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:** 

1.	Students will work to complete a small dataset.

2.	The teacher will lecture on the different data types in the dataset, and the importance of understanding data types.

a.	The teacher will breakdown the different data types used to organize agricultural data:

i.	Names

ii.	Categories

iii.	Dates

iv.	Numbers

v.	Color & Shape

vi.	Notes

vii.	Best Growing Time

b.	The teacher will explain the importance of understanding data types in the context of farmers (enhance organization of data for farmers), AI applications (structured and semi-structured data), and give a real-world example

3.	The teacher will go over the step-by-step instructions to set up their datasets up using Google Sheets.

### Activity #3: Sorting and Filtering Data

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1.	The teacher will explain sorting and filtering of data, going through the step-by-step process to create a filter on all columns and perform sorting on the data set.

a.	Because there are so many steps, teachers should make sure students are following along and pause periodically to check students’ progress. 

b.	The teacher should introduce two formulas for students to use in their datasets and explain the importance of each formula.

•	COUNTIF: Count the number of specific entries in a column. 

•	AVERAGE: Calculate the average value in a numerical column.

c.	Students should ask any questions they may have for clarification.

### Activity #4: What are Data Types?

#### Activity Walkthrough: 

1.	The students should follow along the lesson using SREB_U3_L4_Handout.

2.	The teacher will begin the lesson by briefly describing the contents of the lesson, where students will explore three main data types and their importance.

3.	The teacher will introduce the three main data types and examples of their use:

a.	Structured Data: Data organized in data tables (e.g., crop names, planting dates, water needs); Computers can easily analyze structured data.

•	Why is this type of data so easy to read and analyze?

b.	Semi-Structured Data: Data that is partially organized but not rigidly structured (e.g., CSV file with some rows of missing data); Gives the basics but must be cleaned up for optimal AI use.

•	What problems might arise if AI tries to use this data as-is?

c.	Unstructured Data: Data with no rigid structure (e.g., a photo of a plant, a video of farming techniques); AI can use unstructured data to diagnose problems or make predictions (but it is harder for it to process).

•	How could AI use this image and note to help the farmer?

d.	The teacher should use the Hands-On examples as they go over each data type to provide more information and better understanding for students and briefly discuss the discussion questions for each example.

•	Students will follow along and respond to each discussion question using their worksheets.


### Explore (Develop/Deploy) ~ 25 minutes 
### Activity #1:  Cleaning and Organizing Data

Activity Walkthrough: Build Your Farm Dataset with Unstructured Data

1.	The teacher will guide the class through a step-by-step activity.

    a.	The teacher will help students organize unstructured data into a structured dataset.

    b.	The teacher should answer any questions students may have as they go through the activity.

    c.	Students should follow along and ask the teacher any questions they may have about the activity.

2.	The teacher will initiate a group discussion with the following questions.

    a.	Q1: What did you learn about cleaning messy data today?

    b.	Q2: Why is it important to fix missing and inconsistent information?

    c.	Students will reflect on the questions provided by the teacher.  

### Activity #2: Explaining Tabular Data

**Activity Walkthrough:** 


1.	The teacher will finish the previous with the last step (exporting the dataset as a .csv)

2.	The teacher will facilitate a reflection discussion, and students will share their responses with the class.

    a.	Q1: What did you learn about cleaning messy data today?

    b.	Q2: Why is it important to fix missing and inconsistent information?

3.	The teacher will close the lesson with a brief lecture about Tabular Data, how it functions, and explain why it is better for AI than other data formats.

    a.	Tabular data is like a table where each row is a complete data object, and each column describes a specific feature.   

    b.	AI loves tabular data because it’s structured and ready to use.
        
    c.	String data (like unstructured text) is harder to process and requires extra cleaning before it can be useful. 

### Explain (Refine) ~ 15 minutes
#### Activity #1: Garden Detectives – What’s Growing Around Us

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1.	The teacher will walk through the hands-on activity (“Garden Detectives – What’s Growing Around Us”), where students will act as agriculture scientists to collect and organize real-word agricultural data and create their own datasets.

    a.	Students will gather data from their home kitchen, school cafeteria, grocery store (real or pretend), or from online research

    b.	Students will collect and record fata for the nine following categories: plant/food name, category, color & shape, where it’s found, weather sustainability, water requirement, favorite food, fun fact, and images.

    c.	Once students complete their datasets, the teacher will facilitate a class presentation where each student will share their dataset with the class, followed by a discussion. 

i.	Q1: What challenges might farmers face with messy data?

•	Errors in crop growth, water miscalculations, hard to predict harvests, etc. Messy data makes decision-making much more difficult and unreliable, wasting resources.

ii.	Q2: How does having a structured dataset make a farmer’s job easier?

•	Allows farmers to easily monitor planting schedules, track resources, analyze trends in crops. It's easier to make more informed decisions, maximize yields.

2.	The teacher will lead one last discussion to wrap up the lesson.

a.	Q1: What's one thing you learned today about collecting or organizing data?

b.	Students will complete a Quick Write where they write one sentence summarizing what they have learned.

•	Example: Organizing data helps farmers grow healthy crops and plan better!   

3.	Now that students have developed a better understanding of the lesson, please instruct them to complete and respond to the following handout. **SREB_U3_L4_Handout**.
