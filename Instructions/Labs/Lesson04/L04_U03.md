### Welcome to the World of Data!

Did you know that farmers collect tons of information every day to make sure their crops are healthy, to maintain rich soil, and to run their farms smoothly? Now, imagine if all that data was just scribbled in different notebooks or scattered around — what a mess! That’s why farmers need a more efficient way to organize all of that information and make smart decisions for their farms. Today, we’ll explore how they do it, and guess what? You’ll get to create your very own dataset, too!

### How Do Farmer’s Store Data?
Before we dive into the lesson, let’s start with a big question: Where do you think farmers store their data? You might guess they use notebooks, computers, even just keep it in their heads

Farmers generally use two main methods to store their data:

•	Old School (Traditional Methods): In the past, farmers recorded all their information in logs or notebooks, jotting down details like the amount of rainfall, observations of what their crops looked like, or their crop watering schedules/times.

•	Modern Methods: With today’s technology, farmers now use tools such as Google Sheets, databases, and cloud storage to keep everything organized. These tools help farmers quickly spot patterns and more informed decisions.

### So why organize data?

Think of data like your homework. If you toss all your assignments into a messy pile, it would be difficult to locate a specific assignment. But if you organize them into folders, finding what you need becomes a breeze! 

In the same way, farmers organize their data so that they can:

•	Keep track of what works best for their crops.

•	Plan when to water or harvest their crops.

•	Share their observations or findings with other farmers or scientists.


### Creating a Sample Dataset
Understanding the Data Types in the Dataset
In a dataset, different types of data are used to reflect the real-world variety farmers deal with when organizing agricultural information. Here’s a breakdown of the different data types found in the dataset, and why each of them is important.

1.	Names (Textual Data – Structured Data): 

    - This is structured data because it is neatly categorized and stored in a single column. Farmers use names to identify and categorize different plants or crops for better management
    .
    - Example: Plant Name: Tomato, Blueberry, Lettuce

2.	Categories (Categorical Data – Structured Data):

    - Categorical data groups plants into meaningful categories, making it easy to organize and analyze. Farmers use this data to group similar crops, plan for seasonal demands, or apply specific farming techniques.

    - Example: Category: Vegetable, Fruit, Grain, Herb

3. Dates (Time Data – Structured Data):

    - Dates provide a timeline for when a crop was planted, helping farmers track growth stages and plan harvests.

    - Example: Date Planted: 03/15/2023, 04/01/2023

4.	Numbers (Numerical Data – Structured Data):

    - Although these are written as words, they represent numerical concepts (e.g., Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 3). Farmers use this data to estimate water requirements and plan irrigation schedules efficiently.

    - 
    Example: Water Needs: Low, Medium, High
5.	Color & Shape (Descriptive Text – Semi-Structured Data):

    - Semi-structured data provides detailed descriptions that are easy to interpret but not ideal for numerical analysis. This helps farmers visually identify plants or track specific traits like ripeness or health.

    - Example: Color & Shape: Round, red; Yellow and curved

6.	Notes (Free-Form Text – Semi-Structured Data):

    - Semi-structured data adds context or additional information, making it useful for analysis or problem-solving. Farmers might use notes to document special care instructions or unique challenges for specific crops.

    - Example: Notes: “Requires regular pruning to avoid overgrowth”; “Grows best in acidic soil”
    
7.	Best Growing Time (Time Period – Semi-Structured Data):

    - Semi-structured data indicating the ideal seasons for planting or growing specific crops. Farmers use this to create seasonal planting calendars and rotate crops effectively.

    - Example: Best Growing Time: Summer, Spring/Fall


### Why Understanding Data Types is Important

As you can see, being able to understand the different data types and their uses is necessary for farmers, as it makes it easier to organize their information in order to understand and analyze it. AI applications also benefit from it, as AI relies on structured data to make predictions and recommendations, and semi-structured data can help provide extra context to (fill in) but often requires preprocessing to be useful for AI models. 
Imagine if Netflix were to only use semi-structured data like “People like funny shows.” It wouldn’t work as well as structured data like “This show has a 4.8 rating and was watched 100,000 times last week.” Similarly, organized agricultural data is key to making smart decisions.

Let’s Set Up Our Datasets!

Now that we’ve learned about different ways farmers store data, let’s put that knowledge into practice and organize data like a farmer!

Imagine you’re tracking plants in your South Carolina neighborhood. We’ll set up a small dataset together!

Table 1: Sample Dataset: Plants in South Carolina

![](../media/ag53.png)

![](../media/ag54.png)

1.	To set up your plant dataset in Google Sheets, start by opening Google Drive, clicking + New, and selecting Google Sheets. Name your file “Plant Dataset – South Carolina.” 

2.	Next, add the dataset either by copying and pasting the data directly or entering it manually. To set up your header columns, in the first row type the following: Plant Name, Category, Best Growing Time, Date Planted, Water Needs, Color & Shape, Notes. Once the headers are in place, begin filling in the rows with the sample data.

3.	To style your spreadsheet, you can bold the headers for readability, resize the columns to fit the data, and apply colors to distinguish the different categories (e.g., highlight Vegetables in green and Fruits in yellow).

Congratulations, you have set up your first dataset! Now it’s time to save your work. Your finished dataset should look something like this, shown in Figure 1:

### Sorting and Filtering Data
Now that your dataset is set up, you can start organizing the information for better understanding and analysis of the data. Sorting and filtering can be helpful when trying to locate specific details within your data. We will now go over how to create a filter on all columns and perform sorting in Google Sheets.

Sorting Data Using Filters in Google Sheets

1. To start, open your Google Sheets file with the dataset. Ensure that all the column headers are in the first row. Select the entire dataset by highlighting the entire dataset, including the headers and all rows of data. Then, go to the menu and click Data > Create a Filter. Small filter icons (▼) will appear in each column header, shown in Figures 2 and 3.

    ![](../media/ag56.png)

2. Now we will sort the data by a specific column. Click the filter icon (▼) in the [Header Name] column header (e.g., Plant Name, Best Growing Time, Water Needs, etc.), then select Sort A → Z to organize the items in alphabetical order. Alternatively, select Sort Z → A for reverse alphabetical order, shown in Figure 4.

    ![](../media/ag57.png)

3. Next, we will combine sorting across multiple columns. First, select the dataset by opening the dataset in Google Sheets. Highlight every row and column of your data set including the header row (e.g., Plant Name, Category, etc.).

4. Then, access the “Sort Range” option by going to the top menu, selecting Data > Sort range. Click Advanced range sorting options to open the sorting dialog box, shown in Figure 5.

    ![](../media/ag58.png)

5. In the dialog box, check the option Data has header row (so the headers are not included in the sort), shown in Figure 6.  

    ![](../media/ag59.png)

6. In the "Sort by" dropdown menu, select Category. Choose A → Z to sort categories alphabetically (e.g., Herb, Fruit, Grain, Vegetable).  

7. To add a second sort rule, click Add another sort column in the dialog box. Let’s do one for the “Plant Name” column, shown in Figure 7.

    ![](../media/ag60.png)

8. In the new dropdown menu, select Plant Name. Choose A → Z to alphabetize plant names within each category, shown in Figure 8.    

    ![](../media/ag61.png)

9. To apply sorting, click Sort to apply both sorting rules to your dataset. Now, the dataset will be sorted, shown in Figure 9:

    - Categories will be grouped alphabetically: Fruit, Grain, Herb, Vegetable.

    - Plant Names will be alphabetized within each category.

     ![](../media/ag62.png)    

### Filtering the Data
Now that filters are enabled, let’s explore how to filter specific data.

1.	To filter by category, Click the filter icon (▼) in the Category column header, then uncheck Select All to clear all options, as shown in Figure 10.

    ![](../media/ag63.png)

2. Check only Vegetable to view rows with vegetables in the dataset, shown in Figure 11.

    ![](../media/ag64.png)

3. Click OK to apply the filter. You’ll now see only vegetables in your dataset, shown in Figure 12.    

    ![](../media/ag65.png)

4. Click the filter icon (▼) in the column and Click on Select all and Click OK. This way, you can see all of the data. You can do the same for the other columns (e.g., Plant Names, Water Needs, etc.), shown in Figure 13.    

    ![](../media/ag66.png)

5. Filters can also be combined to narrow down results further. Let’s apply a filter on the Category column (e.g., select Vegetable), shown in Figure 14.    

    ![](../media/ag67.png)

6. Apply another filter on Water Needs (e.g., select Medium).      

    ![](../media/ag68.png)

This will show only vegetables that require medium water needs.

![](../media/ag69.png)

7. To clear or remove a specific filter, Click the filter icon (▼) in the column and Click on Select all and Click OK.  To remove all filters, go to Data > Remove Filter.


### Using Formulas in Google Sheets
Here’s how you can use the COUNTIF and AVERAGE formulas step by step in your dataset.  

#### Formula: COUNTIF (range, criteria)

The purpose of the COUNTIF function is to count the number of specific entries in a column, for example, you could use it count all rows where the Category is “Vegetable.”
Now, let's apply the function to use in our dataset. 

First, ensure that the dataset is properly set up with headers (e.g., "Plant Name," "Category," etc.).  Select a cell for the formula by clicking on an empty cell where you want the result to appear (e.g., H1). Then, enter the formula by typing =COUNTIF (B2:B11, "Vegetable"). 

•	B2:B11: This specifies the range of the Category column (cells B2 through B11). 

•	"Vegetable": This is the criteria for what to count.

Once you have typed in the formula, press Enter. The cell will now display the number of rows where the Category is "Vegetable."  

Here is what your sheet should look like:

![](../media/ag70.png)

#### Formula: AVERAGE (range)  
The AVERAGE function is used to calculate the average value in a numerical column. We can see this, for example, to Find the average water requirement by converting Low, Medium, High to numerical values (Low = 1, Medium = 2, High = 3).  

Start by converting the “Water Needs” column to numbers by inserting a new column (e.g., Column H) and labeling it Water Needs (Numeric).  

![](../media/ag71.png)

Use the following conversion:

•	Low = 1 

•	Medium = 2 

•	High = 3

Then, enter the conversion manually or use a formula. 

In cell H2, type **=IF (E2="Low", 1, IF(E2="Medium", 2, IF(E2="High", 3, 0)))**, and press Enter.

![](../media/ag72.png)

![](../media/ag73.png)

Drag the formula down to apply it to all the rows in the column.

![](../media/ag74.png)

Now, you may select an empty cell where you want the average to appear. Let’s try it out with cell I1. In this cell, type the formula =AVERAGE (H2:H11) and press Enter.

•	H2:H11: This specifies the range of the new numerical column for Water Needs.
