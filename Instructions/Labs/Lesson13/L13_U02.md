## L13 Lesson Plan: Final Project Presentation
### Lesson Description:
In this culminating lesson, students will bring together all they’ve learned in the agriculture unit to build and optimize a smart mini farm using Arduino. Using moisture, light, and temperature sensors, students will collect data from their farms and analyze it using skills developed in Lessons 3–11. They will evaluate their system’s performance, modify it by adding additional sensors, update the code, and collect new data to compare outcomes.  

This project allows students to engage in real-world engineering and data science practices, reinforcing their understanding of structured/unstructured data, hardware/software systems, data types, and machine learning concepts.

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will use previously learned skills to design, build, analyze, and improve a smart farm using Arduino and sensors.

### Essential Question:
How can we design and improve smart farming systems using technology, data, and knowledge from real-world agricultural problems?

### Standards:
•	IAI.A2.3: Identify and define the function of circuits, sensors, microcontrollers, motors, and other components used within given AI solutions. 
•	IAI.C3.1 Identify and use appropriate documentation methods while developing programs (e.g., inline comments, procedure header, purposeful naming)

### Objectives:
•	Apply previously learned data collection, storage, and analysis skills using real-time sensor data.    

•	Build a smart farm prototype using Arduino and environmental sensors. 

•	Evaluate collected sensor data to identify trends and patterns.   

•	Improve their farm design by modifying hardware and code.   

•	Compare performance of original vs. optimized systems using data analysis and visualization.

### Total Duration: 55 minutes (1 day)

#### Important Vocabulary:

1.	Sensor

    a.	Definition: A device that detects or measures physical conditions like temperature.

    b.	Example: A temperature sensor that reads how hot or cold it is in the greenhouse.

2.	Arduino

    a.	Definition: A programmable microcontroller used to build hardware projects

    b.	Example: Using an Arduino to turn on a pump when the soil is too dry.

3.	Data Logger

    a.	Definition: A system that automatically records sensor values over time.

    b.	Example: The Arduino prints soil, light, and temperature data every 2 seconds to the Serial Monitor.

4.	Variable

    a.	Definition: A container in code that stores data.

    b.	Example: int soil = analogRead(A0); — the variable soil stores the moisture level.

5.	For Loop

    a.	Definition: A way to repeat actions in code.

    b.	Example: A for loop that checks several sensors one after another and logs their values.

6.	Data Visualization

    a.	Definition: A visual representation of collected data to find patterns.

    b.	Example: A line graph showing how soil moisture changed over time.


### Engage (Elicit/Develop) ~ 10 minutes

#### Activity Name: Diagram Draw-Up (~10 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:** 

1.	The teacher will instruct students to use an appropriate website (ex. Draw.io) to sketch out their Arduino smart farm set up.

    a.	Only one diagram per group is needed. It will be shown on one of the slides in their presentation.

### Explore (Develop/Deploy) ~ 30 minutes 

#### Activity Name: Presentation Creation Pt.1 (~ 15 minutes)

Activity Walkthrough: 

1.	The teacher will instruct students to use SREB_U3_L13_PresentationTemplatePPT as a template for their slides.

    a .	Students should use their answers from the S**REB_U3_L12_Handout** to begin building out their group presentation by completing the first half of the **SREB_U3_L13_PresentationTemplatePPT**. This part focuses on reflection and drawing conclusions from the project.

    b.	Students will work on the following slides in this activity:

    i.	Diagram sketch: Using the labeled sketch from the previous activity. 

    ii.	Initial data analysis: Using data from round one, students should analyze what they observed.  

#### Activity #2 Name: Presentation Creation Pt.2 (~ 15 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:** 

2.	The teacher will instruct students to use **SREB_U3_L13_PresentationTemplatePPT** as a template for their slides.

    a.	Students will continue to use their answers from the SREB_U3_L12_Handout to finish out the remaining slides of their presentation:

    i.	Modifications made: Students should describe what changes they made to improve their farm setup. 

    ii.	Data comparison: This slide will contain the charts/graphs from round one and round two of data side by side. 

    iii.	Summary slide: Students should explain what changed and if that change made the system better/worst.

### Explain (Refine) ~ 15 minutes

#### Activity Name: Presenting the Final Product (~15 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1.	The teacher will instruct students to present, giving about 3-5 minutes per group.

    a.	While one group presents, the rest of the class will actively listen and fill out the 4-Square Rubric (**SREB_U3_L13_4SquareRubric**).
