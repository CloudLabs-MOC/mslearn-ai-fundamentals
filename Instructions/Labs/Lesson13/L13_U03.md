Lesson 13: Final Project Presentation
Lesson Description:
In this culminating lesson, students will bring together all they’ve learned in the agriculture unit to build and optimize a smart mini farm using Arduino. Using moisture, light, and temperature sensors, students will collect data from their farms and analyze it using skills developed in Lessons 3–11. They will evaluate their system’s performance, modify it by adding additional sensors, update the code, and collect new data to compare outcomes.  
This project allows students to engage in real-world engineering and data science practices, reinforcing their understanding of structured/unstructured data, hardware/software systems, data types, and machine learning concepts.

Main Learning Goal:
Students will use previously learned skills to design, build, analyze, and improve a smart farm using Arduino and sensors.

Essential Question:
How can we design and improve smart farming systems using technology, data, and knowledge from real-world agricultural problems?

Standards:
•	IAI.A2.3: Identify and define the function of circuits, sensors, microcontrollers, motors, and other components used within given AI solutions.  
•	IAI.C3.1 Identify and use appropriate documentation methods while developing programs (e.g., inline comments, procedure header, purposeful naming)

Objectives:
•	Apply previously learned data collection, storage, and analysis skills using real-time sensor data.  
•	Build a smart farm prototype using Arduino and environmental sensors. 
•	Evaluate collected sensor data to identify trends and patterns.  
•	Improve their farm design by modifying hardware and code.  
•	Compare performance of original vs. optimized systems using data analysis and visualization.

 
Diagram Draw-Up
With your group, draw a diagram that shows how your smart farm is set up now, including any new sensors or components you added.
You may use draw.io, or any site as directed by your teacher. Use the tips below to help your group make a neat drawing!
•	Use arrows to show connections (like wires from a sensor to the Arduino).
•	Label each part: temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, LEDs, light sensor, etc.

Presentation Creation
Use SREB_U3_L13_PresentationTemplatePPT  to create your presentation slides. Fill in the following:
•	Diagram drawing: Simply insert your diagram on this slide!
•	Initial data analysis: Summarize your first round of data.
•	Modifications made (hardware and code): List the changes you made after analyzing the first round of data, and why you chose those.
•	Data Comparison: Show both rounds of data side by side. Make sure to touch on your predictions and reality.
•	Summary Slide: Answer the question “How did your decisions improve the system?”

Presenting the Final Product
Now that you have finished your presentations you will be given 5-7 minutes to present your findings to your class! 
While you watch other presentations, please submit feedback to each group using the SREB_U3_L13_4SquareRubric.docx provided to you!
