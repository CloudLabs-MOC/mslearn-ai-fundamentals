# Module 10: Extract data from documents in Azure AI Foundry portal

## Lab overview

**Azure AI Document Intelligence** service enables you to analyze and extract information from forms and documents, and then identify field names and data. 

How does Document Intelligence build upon optical character recognition (OCR)? While OCR can read printed or handwritten documents, OCR extracts text in an unstructured format which is difficult to store in a database or analyze. Document intelligence makes sense of the unstructured data by capturing the structure of the text, such as data fields and information in tables. 

In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt models in the Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to recognize data from a receipt. 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
- Task 1: Create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry

    ![](./media/lab6-5.png)

1. Wait for your project created.

1. When the project is created, you will be taken to an *Overview* page of the project details. Select **AI services** on the left-hand menu. 

1. On the *AI Services* page, select the *Vision + Document* tile to try out Azure AI Vision and Document capabilities.

## Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry 

In this task, we are using Azure AI Foundry to analyze a receipt image with prebuilt AI models, extracting key details like merchant information, transaction date, and total amount.

You are now ready to analyze a receipt for the fictitious Northwind Traders retail company.

1. In a new browser window, open the [Azure AI services exploration page](https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices).

1. In the **Overview (1)** page of your project, on the left-hand menu on the screen, select **AI Services (2)**.

### Review

In this Module, you have used Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipts model in the Azure AI Foundry portal. From the results that were returned, you saw how Document Intelligence was able to identify specific fields, enabling data from everyday documents to be more easily processed. Before you close the demo, why not try some of the sample receipts, including those in different languages?

In this Module, you have completed the following tasks:
- Created a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Analyzed a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry
