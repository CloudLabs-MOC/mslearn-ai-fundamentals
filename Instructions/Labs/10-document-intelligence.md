# Module 3b: Extract data from documents in the Azure AI Foundry portal

## Lab overview

**Azure AI Document Intelligence** service enables you to analyze and extract information from forms and documents, and then identify field names and data. 

How does Document Intelligence build upon optical character recognition (OCR)? While OCR can read printed or handwritten documents, OCR extracts text in an unstructured format which is difficult to store in a database or analyze. Document intelligence makes sense of the unstructured data by capturing the structure of the text, such as data fields and information in tables. 

In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt models in the Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to recognize data from a receipt. 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
- Task 1: Create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry

## Task 1: Create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal

1. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it's open)

1. In the browser, navigate to `https://ai.azure.com/managementCenter/allResources` and select **Create new**.

1. Choose the option to create a **AI hub resource (1)** then select **Next (2)**.

   ![](./media/lab3-20.png) 

1. In the **Create a new project** wizard, enter project name **Myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**, and select newly created **Myhub-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)** and select **Create (3)**.

    ![](./media/T1S13new-0906(1).png)

1. Wait for your project to be created.

1. When the project is created, you will be taken to an *Overview* page of the project details. Select **AI services** on the left-hand menu. 

## Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry 

In this task, we are using Azure AI Foundry to analyze a receipt image with prebuilt AI models, extracting key details like merchant information, transaction date, and total amount.

You are now ready to analyze a fictitious Northwind Traders retail company receipt.

1. In the **Overview (1)** page of your project, on the left-hand menu on the screen, select **AI Services (2)**.
 
    ![Screenshot of the left-hand menu on the project screen with AI Services selected.](./media/17-5.png)  

    >**Note**: If a pop-up appears, please click **Close**.

1. On the **AI Services** page, select the **Vision + Document** tile to try out Azure AI Vision and Document capabilities.

    ![Screenshot of the Vision and Document tile selected on the AI Services page.](./media/17-6(2).png)

1. On the *Vision + Document* page, scroll down and select **Document (1)**. Under *Prebuilt models for specific documents*, select the **Receipts (2)** tile.

1. When the analysis has run, the results are returned. Notice that the service has recognized specific data fields such as the merchantâ€™s name, address, phone number, and transaction date and time, as well as the line items, subtotal, tax, and total amounts. Next to each field is a percentage probability that the field is correct.

### Review

In this Module, you have used Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipts model in the Azure AI Foundry portal. From the results that were returned, you saw how Document Intelligence was able to identify specific fields, enabling data from everyday documents to be more easily processed. Before you close the demo, why not try some of the sample receipts, including those in different languages?

In this Module, you have completed the following tasks:
- Created a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Analyzed a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry
