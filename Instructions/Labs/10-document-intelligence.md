# Module 10: Extract data from documents in Azure AI Foundry portal

## Lab overview

**Azure AI Document Intelligence** service enables you to analyze and extract information from forms and documents, and then identify field names and data. 

How does Document Intelligence build upon optical character recognition (OCR)? While OCR can read printed or handwritten documents, OCR extracts text in an unstructured format which is difficult to store in a database or analyze. Document intelligence makes sense of the unstructured data by capturing the structure of the text, such as data fields and information in tables. 

In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt models in Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to recognize data from a receipt. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
- Task 1: Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal
- Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry

## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

1. On the **Create a project** pane, Configure it with the following settings:

    - **Hub name**: Enter **myhub<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
    - **Subscription**: **Use existing Azure subscription (2)**
    - **Resource group**: Select **AI-900-Module-19 (3)**
    - **Location**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/> (4)**
    - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI Service**:
    Click on **Create new AI Services (5)** and provide name **AI<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (6)** and click on **Next**
    - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Leave as default **(7)**
    - Click on **Next (8)**

        ![](./media/19-3.png)

    > **Important**: You will need an Azure AI services resource provisioned in a specific location to complete the rest of the lab.

1. On the **Review and Finish** page, click on **Create**.

    ![](./media/19-2.png)

1. Keep track of the following created resources: 
    
    - **Azure AI Project**
    - **Azure AI Hub**  
    - **Azure AI Services**    
    - **Storage Account**  
    - **Key Vault**

## Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry 

In this task, we are using Azure AI Foundry to analyze a receipt image with prebuilt AI models, extracting key details like merchant information, transaction date, and total amount.

You are now ready to analyze a receipt for the fictitious Northwind Traders retail company.

1. In the **Overview (1)** page of your project, on the left-hand menu on the screen, select **AI Services (2)**.
 
    ![Screenshot of the left-hand menu on the project screen with AI Services selected.](./media/17-5.png)  

    >**Note**: If a pop-up appears, please click **Close**.

1. On the **AI Services** page, select the **Vision + Document** tile to try out Azure AI Vision and Document capabilities.

    ![Screenshot of the Vision and Document tile selected on the AI Services page.](./media/17-6.png)

1. On the *Vision + Document* page, scroll down and select **Document (1)**. Under *Prebuilt models for specific documents*, select the **Receipts (2)** tile.

    ![](media/19-1.png)

1. In the drop-down list under *Try it out*, note that your Azure AI services resource is selected. Leave it as-is.

1. On your computer, use [**https://aka.ms/mslearn-receipt**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-receipt) to open a sample image of a receipt. Save it in your Downloads folder or to your Desktop. 
 
1. In Azure AI Foundry, on the *Receipts* page, select **Browse for files** and navigate to the folder where you saved the picture. Select the picture of the receipt and then **Open**. The image appears on the left side of the screen.

1. On the right, select **Run analysis**.

1. When the analysis has run, the results are returned. Notice that the service has recognized specific data fields such as the merchantâ€™s name, address, phone number, and transaction date and time, as well as the line items, subtotal, tax, and total amounts. Next to each field is a percentage probability that the field is correct.

### Review

In this Module, you have used Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipts model in Azure AI Foundry portal. From the results that were returned, you saw how Document Intelligence was able to identify specific fields, enabling data from everyday documents to be more easily processed. Before you close the demo, why not try some of the sample receipts, including those in different languages?

In this Module, you have completed the following tasks:
- Created a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Analyzed a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry
