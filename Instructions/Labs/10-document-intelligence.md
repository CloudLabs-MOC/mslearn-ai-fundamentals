# Module 10: Extract data from documents in Azure AI Foundry portal

## Lab overview

**Azure AI Document Intelligence** service enables you to analyze and extract information from forms and documents, and then identify field names and data. 

How does Document Intelligence build upon optical character recognition (OCR)? While OCR can read printed or handwritten documents, OCR extracts text in an unstructured format which is difficult to store in a database or analyze. Document intelligence makes sense of the unstructured data by capturing the structure of the text, such as data fields and information in tables. 

In this exercise, you will use Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt models in the Azure AI Foundry portal, Microsoft's platform for creating intelligent applications, to recognize data from a receipt. 

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will perform:
- Task 1: Create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry

## Task 1: Create a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal

In this task, we are creating an Azure AI Foundry project and setting up AI resources to explore Vision and Document capabilities.

1. Right-click on the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com?azure-portal=true) **(1)** link, select **Copy link (2)** from the context menu, then paste it into a new tab to access the Azure AI Foundry portal.

1. Close any tips or quick start panes that are opened the first time you sign in, and if necessary use the **Azure AI Foundry** logo at the top left to navigate to the home page, which looks similar to the following image (close the **Help** pane if it's open)

1. On the home page, select **Create an agent**.

1. In the **Create an agent** wizard, enter project name **Myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)** and then expand **Advanced options**.

1. Select **Advanced options** and specify the following settings:

   - **Subscription**: **Use existing Azure subscription (2)**
   - **Resource group**: Select **AI-900-Module-10 (3)**
   - **Azure AI Foundry resource**: **Keep the default name (4)**
   - **Region**: Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/> (5)**
   - Select **Create (6)**

1. Review your configuration. Wait for the setup process to complete.

1. When your project is created, you will be brought by default to the Agents playground in the Azure AI Foundry portal, which should look similar to the following image:

## Task 2: Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry 

In this task, we are using Azure AI Foundry to analyze a receipt image with prebuilt AI models, extracting key details like merchant information, transaction date, and total amount.

You are now ready to analyze a receipt for the fictitious Northwind Traders retail company.

1. In a new browser window, open the [Azure AI services exploration page](https://ai.azure.com/explore/aiservices).

1. In the **Overview (1)** page of your project, on the left-hand menu on the screen, select **AI Services (2)**.
 
    ![Screenshot of the left-hand menu on the project screen with AI Services selected.](./media/17-5.png)  

    >**Note**: If a pop-up appears, please click **Close**.

1. On the **AI Services** page, select the **Vision + Document** tile to try out Azure AI Vision and Document capabilities.

    ![Screenshot of the Vision and Document tile selected on the AI Services page.](./media/17-6.png)

1. On the *Vision + Document* page, scroll down and select **Document (1)**. Under *Prebuilt models for specific documents*, select the **Receipts (2)** tile.

    ![](media/19-1.png)

1. On the **Add captions to images** page, click on **Select a hub** under **Try It Out** subheading.

    ![](./media/lab3-14.png)

1. On the Select a Hub page, choose **Create a New Hub**.

1. On the Create a new hub page, enter the following details:

   - **Hub name:** Select **myhub<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
   - **Subscription:** **Use existing Azure subscription (2)**
   - **Resource group:** Select **AI-900-Module-10 (3)** 
   - **Location:** Select **<inject key="location" enableCopy="false"/> (4)**
   - **Connect Azure AI Services or Azure OpenAI Service**: Leave as default **(5)**
   - **Connect Azure AI Search**: Click on **Create new AI Services** and provide name **AI<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (6)**.
   - Click on **Next (7)**

      ![](./media/lab3-16.png)

1. On the **Review and Finish** page, click on **Create**.

   ![](./media/lab3-17.png)

1. On the **You'll need a project to keep working** enter **myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)** and click on **Create project (2)**.

    ![](./media/lab3-18.png)

1. Open a new tab and go to [**https://aka.ms/mslearn-receipt**](https://aka.ms/mslearn-receipt) to view a sample image of a receipt.

1. Right-click on the image and choose **"Save image as"** to save it in your Downloads folder or to your Desktop.

   ![](media/ai900m10-5.png)

1. Click on **Save**.

   ![](media/ai900m10-6.png)
 
1. Go back to the Azure AI Foundry portal and upload the **receipt.jpg** image by clicking **Browse files (1)**. Then, navigate to the **C:\Users\azureuser\Downloads (2)** folder, select **receipt (3)**, and click **Open (4)**.

   ![](media/10-3.png)

1. Click **Run analysis** to process the document.

   ![](media/10-1.png)

1. When the analysis has run, the results are returned. Notice that the service has recognized specific data fields such as the merchantâ€™s name, address, phone number, and transaction date and time, as well as the line items, subtotal, tax, and total amounts. Next to each field is a percentage probability that the field is correct.

### Review

In this Module, you have used Azure AI Document Intelligence's prebuilt receipts model in the Azure AI Foundry portal. From the results that were returned, you saw how Document Intelligence was able to identify specific fields, enabling data from everyday documents to be more easily processed. Before you close the demo, why not try some of the sample receipts, including those in different languages?

In this Module, you have completed the following tasks:
- Created a project in the Azure AI Foundry portal
- Analyzed a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry
