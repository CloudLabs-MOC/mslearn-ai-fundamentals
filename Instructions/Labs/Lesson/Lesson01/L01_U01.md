# The Evolution of Agriculture 

Welcome back data engineers! Fantastic work on your healthcare campaign! Your expertise and innovation made such a strong impact that the Predictive Care Insights company has referred you to other industry leaders who are eager to harness your skills.
Your local agricultural extension office is seeking experts to help modernize farms and greenhouses in the region using data and AI. They’re looking for innovative ideas to revolutionize the field of agriculture. But before we discuss their requirements, we need to ensure we have a good understanding of agriculture—what it is, why it’s important, and how technology is shaping its future.

## Answer the following questions to take notes during today’s informational meeting:

1.	What is agriculture? What are some key components of agriculture?

### After the video demonstration, answers these questions:

1.	What are some benefits of using machines for milking compared to milking by hand? Are there any drawbacks?


1.	How does automation impact the timing and frequency of milking, and what benefits or challenges does this create for farmers and cows?

1. Do you think automated milking systems improve or worsen the welfare of cows? Why?

#### Before the extension office assigns you your task, you'll need to demonstrate your expertise with a bit of research. Some farming practices you can research are:

a. Watering

b. Harvesting

c. Weeding

d. Plowing

e. Spraying

f. Pest control

g. Seed planting

h. Soil management

i. Crop protection

j. Storage protection

#### You will need to create a trifold research “poster” to demonstrate your skills. You will research how your farming practice was accomplished in the pre-1800s, 1800s-1900s, and 2000s-Present. Each era must include:

• How the task was accomplished

• The benefits using technology has had on the task

• The challenges using technology has had on the task

Once you’ve established your skills, the extension office is ready to entrust you with the job description:

“We’ve heard of the work you did for Predictive Care Insights and would like to bring you on as consultants. Your mission is to help modernize agricultural entities in our region by integrating sensors and data-driven solutions. To accomplish this, you’ll collaborate with other local extension offices to understand the agricultural landscape and stakeholder needs for improved agricultural practices.
Using this information, you will need to design, build, and present a model farm/greenhouse to showcase to the extension office and agricultural stakeholders. These models will serve as a blueprint for the future of our region’s farming and greenhouse operations.”

With so much ground to cover, let’s get started!


As today’s meeting comes to an end, reflect on these questions and how they may apply to the final presentation:

• What are some advantages and challenges of using sensors and AI in agriculture?


• What are some real-world agricultural problems that AI and technology could help solve?


• How can we balance sustainability with technological advancements in agriculture?
