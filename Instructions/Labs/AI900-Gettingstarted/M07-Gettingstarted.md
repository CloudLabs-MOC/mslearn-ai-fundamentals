# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 07: Use Question Answering with the Language Studio

### Overall Estimated timing: 45 minutes

## Overview:

In this lab, you will use Azure Language Studio to create and train a knowledge base for question answering. You will build the knowledge base using FAQ content from the website of a fictitious travel agency called Margie’s Travel. The lab demonstrates how to use Azure’s Question Answering capabilities to create a knowledge base, train it, and deploy it for answering customer queries using the natural language processing features of Azure AI.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Create a Language resource to enable text analysis and natural language processing.

2. Create a new project in Language Studio to start building a knowledge base.

3. Edit and refine the knowledge base by adding custom question and answer pairs.

4. Train and test the knowledge base to evaluate its accuracy in answering questions.

5. Deploy the knowledge base as a bot or service for real-world applications.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of natural language processing and text analysis and familiarity with the Azure portal and Language Studio.

## Architecture

This lab leverages the following components:

1. **Language Resource**: A service in Azure that enables various AI-powered text processing and natural language understanding tasks.

2. **Language Studio**: The interface where users interact with the Language resource to create, manage, and deploy custom question-answering models.

3. **Knowledge Base**: A structured repository of question-answer pairs, either created manually or extracted from documents or web pages.

4. **Azure Cognitive Search**: A service that indexes and retrieves information from documents or web pages to power the knowledge base.

5. **Question Answering Model**: A machine learning model that interprets questions and retrieves the most relevant answers from the knowledge base.

## Explanation of Components:

1. **Language Resource**: A managed Azure service that provides a variety of AI capabilities, including natural language understanding, text analysis, and the ability to create question-answering models. This resource is essential for enabling your knowledge base to interpret user queries and return meaningful responses.

2. **Language Studio**: Language Studio is the web-based interface where you can create and manage Language resources. In this lab, you will use Language Studio to build and refine a custom knowledge base based on FAQ content, test it, and deploy it for answering customer queries.

3. **Knowledge Base**: A collection of question-answer pairs that are used to train a question-answering model. In this lab, the knowledge base is built from the FAQ document provided by Margie’s Travel, but it can be expanded or modified with additional information as needed.

4. **Azure Cognitive Search**: A search and indexing service that is used to power the knowledge base, allowing it to efficiently index large sets of information and retrieve relevant answers to user queries. The search service is integrated into the Language service to ensure quick and accurate responses.

5. **Question Answering Model**: A model powered by natural language processing (NLP) that processes user queries and searches the knowledge base for the most relevant answer. The model also supports features like providing short answers or including detailed passages from documents for further context.
