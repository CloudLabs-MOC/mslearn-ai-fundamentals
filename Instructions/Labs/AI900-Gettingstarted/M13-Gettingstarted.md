# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 13: Azure AI Studio

### Overall Estimated timing: 45 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience in leveraging Azure AI Foundry to build and manage AI solutions. You will learn how to navigate the Azure AI Foundry portal, create an Azure AI hub and project, and integrate connected resources to enhance your AI capabilities. Additionally, you'll explore various AI services available in Azure AI Foundry and deploy a generative AI model, testing its functionality in real-world scenarios. By the end of this lab, you'll be proficient in setting up AI projects, integrating resources, and deploying generative AI models, equipping you with essential skills to develop and manage AI-powered solutions in Azure.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a project in Azure AI Foundry and analyze a receipt using Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract key information efficiently

- **Open Azure AI Foundry portal**
- **Create an Azure AI hub and project**
- **Add a connected resource**
- **Explore AI Services**
- **Deploy and test a generative AI model**

## Pre-requisites Required

The solution you'll create for Fourth Coffee requires the following resources in your Azure subscription:

- An **Azure AI Search** resource, which will manage indexing and querying.

- An **Azure AI services** resource, which provides AI services for skills that your search solution can use to enrich the data in the data source with AI-generated insights.

    > **Note**
    > Your Azure AI Search and Azure AI services resources must be in the same location!

- A **Storage account** with blob containers, which will store raw documents and other collections of tables, objects, or files.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Create a project in Azure AI Foundry portal**: Understanding how to set up a new project in Azure AI Foundry, including configuring AI resources to support Vision and Document Intelligence capabilities. This involves selecting the appropriate AI models, setting up access permissions, and ensuring the project is properly structured for document processing workflows.

1. **Analyze a receipt with Azure AI Document Intelligence in Azure AI Foundry**:  Learning how to upload and analyze a receipt using Azure AI Document Intelligence. This includes extracting key details such as the merchant name, transaction date, and total amount, and understanding how to interpret the extracted data for further processing or integration into business applications.
