# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 01: Explore Automated Machine Learning in Azure Machine Learning

### Overall Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll gain practical experience in using Azure Machine Learning to automate the process of training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models. You will learn how to create an Azure Machine Learning workspace, utilize automated machine learning to train a model, and deploy the trained model as a web service. By following step-by-step tasks, you'll explore how to configure your workspace, train a predictive model using historical data, and deploy it for real-time predictions. By the end of this lab, you'll be proficient in using Azure Machine Learning's automated capabilities, empowering you with the skills to apply machine learning in real-world scenarios without extensive coding.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a workspace in Azure Machine Learning, use automated machine learning to train a predictive model, and deploy the model as a web service.

1. **Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace**: You will learn how to set up and configure an Azure Machine Learning workspace, which is the foundation for managing your machine learning resources and experiments.

2. **Train a model using automated machine learning**: You will explore how to use Azure’s automated machine learning feature to train a model that predicts bike rentals, using a dataset with historical rental data, and evaluating different models for optimal performance.

3. **Deploy the model as a web service**: You will learn how to deploy the trained model as a web service for real-time predictions, enabling you to integrate the model into applications for practical use.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure Machine Learning and machine learning concepts. Familiarity with working in the Azure Portal and understanding of datasets and model training would be beneficial.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Azure Machine Learning Workspace and AutoML**: Set up a workspace and use AutoML to train a model on bike rental data, automatically evaluating multiple algorithms for the best performance.

2. **Model Deployment as a Web Service**: Deploy the trained model as a web service using Azure Container Instances, providing a REST API endpoint for real-time predictions.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**: A centralized platform for managing machine learning resources, experiments, and models. It allows users to set up, train, and evaluate models efficiently while managing datasets and compute resources.

2. **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**: A feature in Azure Machine Learning that automates the process of model selection, training, and evaluation. It allows users to quickly build and optimize models without extensive coding by trying multiple algorithms and configurations.
