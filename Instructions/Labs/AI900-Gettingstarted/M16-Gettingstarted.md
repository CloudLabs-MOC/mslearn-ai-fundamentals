# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 5: Explore AI Agent development

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you'll learn how to create and deploy a generative AI model using Azure AI Foundry. You'll then build and test an AI agent capable of performing language tasks like translation and detection.

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

1. Create an Azure AI Foundry project using the gpt-4o model
2. Create an AI agent
3. Test your agent

## Pre-requisites

Familiarity with a language generative AI model.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will work with a streamlined architecture integrating Azure services to build and test an AI agent. The key components include:

1. **Azure AI Foundry Portal**: Centralized platform for managing AI projects, models, and services.

2. **AI Hub**: A container for organizing AI projects.

3. **Chat Playground**: Interface for interacting with the model and testing content filtering.

4. **AI agent**: An autonomous system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and performs tasks to achieve specific goals.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure AI Foundry Portal**: The portal provides a user-friendly interface for managing AI models and resources. It allows users to deploy, configure, and monitor generative AI models.

2. **AI Hub**: An organizational structure within Azure AI Foundry. It enables you to manage and track multiple projects and related resources, keeping your AI work organized.

3. **GPT-4o Model**: A generative language model deployed in Azure AI Foundry to produce text. You can customize it and apply content filters to ensure outputs are ethical and adhere to guidelines.

4. **AI agent**: A custom-built agent that uses API calls to interact with the Generative AI and Translator services for tasks like text translation and language detection.
