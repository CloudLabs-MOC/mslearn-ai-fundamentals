# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 02: Explore the Content Safety Studio

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you'll explore the Azure AI Content Safety Studio to evaluate and moderate text and image content. By creating a Content Safety service, associating it with the studio, and running moderation tests, you’ll gain insights into the severity levels of different types of content. The lab will guide you through exploring text moderation, analyzing results, and checking the necessary keys and endpoints for integrating the service with your applications.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to use the Azure AI Content Safety Studio to moderate and evaluate text content based on severity levels. You will learn to:

1.**Set up a Content Safety resource**: Create and associate an Azure Content Safety resource with the Content Safety Studio to evaluate and moderate content.

2.**Perform text moderation**: Analyze text content for harmful categories and review moderation results.

3.**Check keys and endpoint**: Retrieve and use keys and endpoints for integrating the Content Safety service into your applications.

## Pre-requisites

Basic knowledge of Azure and Azure Portal and familiarity with AI concepts related to content moderation.

## Architecture

In this lab, the architecture flow involves the following components:

1.**Azure AI Content Safety Studio**: This is the main platform where you will associate a Content Safety resource and run moderation tests. It provides an interface to evaluate and categorize text and image content based on severity scores.

2.**Azure Content Safety Resource**: The resource is provisioned and associated with the Content Safety Studio. It provides the necessary capabilities to analyze and moderate text and image content in real-time.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure AI Content Safety Studio**: A platform within Azure AI designed to manage and moderate text and image content by evaluating it for harmful or inappropriate categories. It provides easy-to-use tools to test and analyze content using AI-based moderation models.

2. **Azure Content Safety Resource**: A service that analyzes content (text and images) and assigns severity scores based on categories like violence, hate speech, or explicit content. This resource is configured within the Azure portal and linked to the Content Safety Studio for testing and integration.
