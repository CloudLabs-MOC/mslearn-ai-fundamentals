# AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Workshop

Welcome to your AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Module 14: Explore content filters in Azure AI Foundry

### Overall Estimated timing: 30 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you’ll explore the content filters in Azure AI Foundry to ensure responsible AI behavior. You’ll deploy a model, set up content filters to manage harmful outputs, and generate natural language content using Azure's generative AI capabilities. This exercise is vital for understanding how to ensure ethical AI development and deployment.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create a project in Azure AI Foundry and analyze a receipt using Azure AI Document Intelligence to extract key information efficiently

1. Create an AI hub and project in Azure AI Foundry.

2. Deploy the GPT-4o model for natural language generation.

3. Explore and customize content filters to prevent harmful outputs.

4. Generate natural language output through the deployed model.

## Pre-requisites

Familiarity with Azure AI services and deploying models in a cloud environment and basic understanding of content filtering and responsible AI practices.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Azure AI Foundry Portal**: Centralized platform for managing AI projects, models, and services.

2. **AI Hub**: A container for organizing AI projects.

3. **Content Filters**: Applied to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate content based on defined categories (Hate, Sexual, Violence, Self-harm).

4. **Chat Playground**: Interface for interacting with the model and testing content filtering.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure AI Foundry Portal**: The portal provides a user-friendly interface for managing AI models and resources. It allows users to deploy, configure, and monitor generative AI models.

2. **AI Hub**: An organizational structure within Azure AI Foundry. It enables you to manage and track multiple projects and related resources, keeping your AI work organized.

3. **GPT-4o Model**: A generative language model deployed in Azure AI Foundry to produce text. You can customize it and apply content filters to ensure outputs are ethical and adhere to guidelines.

4. **Content Filters**: These filters help monitor and control the output of generative AI models. Filters can be set for different levels of severity (safe, low, medium, high) for categories like hate speech, sexual content, violence, and self-harm.

5. **Chat Playground**: The interactive space for testing the AI model. You can provide prompts and see how the model responds, while also ensuring that the content adheres to the rules set by the content filters.
