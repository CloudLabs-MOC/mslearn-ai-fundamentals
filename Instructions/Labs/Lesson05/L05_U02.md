### Explore (Develop/Deploy) ~ 30 minutes 
#### Activity Name: Using Excel to Analyze Corn Data (~30 minutes)
**Activity Walkthrough:** 
1.	We’ll be analyzing data on corn hybrids grown in South Carolina, which can be accessed using SREB_U3_L5_ClemsonData.

    a.	The dataset presents statewide averages for corn hybrid performance across various companies from 2020 to 2024. For ease of analysis, the data was compiled from five datasets, and the original datasets are also available here. Additionally, Clemson University provides similar data for other crops grown in South Carolina, including cotton, peanuts, and soybeans, which can be explored here.

2. In Figure 1 below, you can see the different columns for this data set: **Company or Brand Name, Hybrid, Yield (BU/A), Harvest Moisture (PCT), and Test Weight (LB/BU).**

   ![](../media/ag96.png)

    a.	Based off the columns and their values, the teacher will instruct the students to fill in the data type for each column in SREB_U3_L5_Handout.
    
    b.	Q1: What is the data type for each column?  

    - Company or Brand Name: Name of the company or brand producing the corn 

    - Hybrid: Type of corn hybrid being grown  

    - Yield (BU/A): Amount of agricultural production harvested measured by bushels per acre (BU/A) (bushels are defined as 56lbs for corn)  

    - Harvest Moisture (PCT): Moisture level of the corn at time of harvest, represented as a percentage (PCT) 

    - Test Weight (LB/BU): Weight of corn grain per bushel. Indicates the quality of the grain, and higher test weight is generally preferred.

    c.	Q2: If we wanted to analyze the results, we’d need to perform operations on the data. Try calculating the average yield yourself. 

    - 184.58 BU/A

3. The teacher will now walk students through calculating the average corn yield in Excel.

    a.	Open SREB_U3_L5_ClemsonData.

    b.	Let’s first get an average for the yield of corn produced each year, using 2020 as an example.

    i.	In the cell under 2020 (**cell H2**), begin typing **“=AVERAGE(“**

    ii.	Then select the first cell in the **Yield** column for the year 2020 (**cell C2**). This will select this cell as the start of the list of numbers to average.

     ![](../media/ag97.png)    

    iii. Scroll down to the last cell in the Yield column for the year 2020 and hold “CTRL+SHIFT” before clicking the last cell (cell C48). This will select all the numbers between the first cell and the last cell to average. Note how it averages the cells C2 through C48.

     ![](../media/ag98.png)     


    iv.	Hit “Enter” and the average of the yield of corn in 2020 will be calculated!

    v.	Repeat this with all the years. You should see the following result:

     ![](../media/ag99.png)    

4. The teacher will now instruct the students to calculate the following questions on their own using SREB_U3_L5_ClemsonData.

    a. Q1: What is the average yield difference between 2020 and 2024?

    i. This can be found using the minus (-) operator

    ii. Start by writing “=” then select the first value, type “-”, then select the second value

    iii. It should result in a query like this: 

     ![](../media/ag100.png)    

    iv.	Then hit “Enter” to calculate the result

    v.	 Answer: 0.510638 

    b.	**Q2: What is the average total yield of all 5 years of production?** 

    i.	This can be found using the **SUMMING** the average yields per year

    ii.	It should result in a query like this: 

     ![](../media/ag101.png)

    iii.	Hit “Enter” to calculate the result

    iv.	Answer: 896.3567

    c. **Q3: What is the yield average in the 5 years of production?**

    i.	**Notice this question isn’t asking for an average of averages**. That means we should take an average of ALL the values for yield instead of the average of the average yields per year.

    ii.	As before, start by typing **“=AVERAGE(“** and selecting the first value in the Yield column

    iii.	Now execute **“CTRL+SHIFT+DOWN”**. This will select all the values in the column until the data ends.

    iv.	It should result in a query like this:      

     ![](../media/ag102.png)                           

    v.	Hit “Enter” to calculate the result

    vi.	Answer: 179.405 

    d. **Q4: What is the max average yield difference within the 5 years of production? What year was the max? What year was the minimum?** 

    i.	We want to be subtracting the max average yield from the minimum average yield within the five years

    ii.	This can be found using the **MAX, MIN, and minus (-)** functions.

    iii. The max can be calculated like so:     

     ![](../media/ag103.png)                                                             
    iv. The min can be calculated like so:                                                                      
     ![](../media/ag104.png)    

    v. Using the minus operator, we can subtract the min from the max.                                          
     ![](../media/ag105.png) 

    vi. Hit “Enter” to calculate the result

    vii. Answer: Minimum: 2023, Maximum: 2021

    e. This should be the final answer:
