### Explore (Develop/Deploy) ~ 35 minutes 

#### Activity Name: Exploring Data Analysis Tools (~ 10 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1.	The teacher will begin with a brief introduction on how farmers analyzed data in the past compared to how they analyze it today. 

    a. **In the past:**

    i. Farmers used to write everything down in notebooks.  

    ii. They would calculate things like rainfall averages or soil conditions by hand.  

    iii. For example: If they measured rainfall every day for a week, they’d have to add it all up and divide to find the average. 

    b. **Today:** 

    i. Farmers use computers and tools like Excel or Google Sheets to do the same work in seconds.

    ii.	Computers can even create graphs to show patterns in the data!

2. The teacher will guide students through the Excel exercise under the sheet named “Average Rainfall” in SREB_U3_L3_ExcelWorkbook

    a. The completed result of this exercise can be found in the first sheet of: SREB_U3_L3_ExcelWorkbookCompleted

    b. First, students will open the Excel workbook and label Column A as “Day” and Column B as “Rainfall (inches)”

    c.	Students will then input data. For Column A, students will enter numbers 1 through 7, which represent the days of the week. For Column B, students will enter the corresponding rainfall amounts: 0.5, 0.8, 0.2, 1.0, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7.

    ![](../media/ag21.png)

### Day 2 Engage (Elicit/Develop) ~ 15 minutes

#### Activity Name: Introduction to Data Representation (~ 5 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1. The teacher will explain the differences between old-school charts and modern tech charts. 

    a. Old-School Example: Hand-Drawn Chart. 
    i. Let’s say a farmer wants to track how much food they harvested in three months:  
    - January: 25 tons  
    - February: 30 tons  
    - March: 28 tons 

    ii. On the board, draw a quick bar chart by hand to show this data. The bars might be uneven, the labels messy, and the lines shaky—just like how farmers might have tracked this information before computers. 

    iii. The teacher will ask: 

    Q1: Can you quickly tell which month had the best harvest?” 

    Q2: What if the numbers change? Would the farmer have to erase and redraw the chart? 

    b. Modern Tech Example: Digital Graph 
Open Google Sheets or Excel and create a digital bar graph with the same data:  

    • X-axis: January, February, March (the months).  
    • Y-axis: Crop yields in tons.  
    • Use bright, colorful bars and clear labels to make it neat and easy to read.  


### Explore (Develop/Deploy) ~ 25 minutes 
Activity Name: Creating Graphs (~ 10 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1. The teacher will introduce the student’s task as follows:

    a. “Your farmer friend Bob is asking if you could find the average ton of crops he’s harvested every week for the past 20 weeks.”

    b. The crop yield data can be found in the second sheet of SREB_U3_L3_ExcelWorkbook

2. The teacher will instruct students to use the data to create two charts: a clustered column chart, and a line chart. The steps will be like the previous activity. Students will need to highlight the crop yields column, click on insert chart, and choose the specified chart.

    a. Students completed chart should look like the following images:

    ![](../media/ag28.png)

3. Once the students are done, the teacher will instruct them to answer the following questions in SREB_U3_L3_Handout_DataInAg

    a. **Q1: Which graph (bar or line) would make it easier for Bob to see the crop yields for a single week?** 

    - i. The bar graph makes it easier for Bob to see the crop yields for a single week because each bar represents a specific week's yield with a clear visual height.

    b. **Q2: Which graph helps Bob see the overall trend (whether the yields are going up or down)?**

    - i. The line graph helps Bob see the overall trend in crop yields over time because the connected points show whether yields are increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating.

    c. **Q3: Write a few sentences about which graph you think is more helpful for Bob and his farmer friends and why.**

    - i. The most helpful graph depends on what Bob needs. If he wants to check the yield for a specific week, the bar graph is clearer. However, if he wants to see patterns or trends over multiple weeks, the line graph is better because it visually connects the data points, making changes over time more noticeable.


4. The teacher will ask students to share their results by showing to the class their graphs and explain: 

    a. Q1: What does your data reveal about the crop yields?   

    b.	Q2: Which graph did you like better and why?   

    c.	Q3: How do you think these graphs could help farmers make decisions?

### Activity Name: Hands-On Visualization (~10 minutes)

Activity Walkthrough:

1. The teacher will ask students to create graphs using the dataset from Day 1.  

    a. Open the Data: Use the dataset from Day 1 that your group worked on (e.g., rainfall data, soil pH, or crop yields).

    b. Create your Graph: 

    • Highlight the data you want to use.  
    • Go to Insert > Chart (or similar option in Excel).  
    • Choose either a Bar Graph or a Line Chart (your choice). 
    c. Customize it: 
    • Add a title (e.g., “Rainfall Over 7 Days”). 
    • Label the axes: 

    - i. X-Axis: Days, fields, or months.

    - ii.	Y-Axis: Rainfall, pH levels, or yields.

### Explain (Refine) ~ 10 minutes
