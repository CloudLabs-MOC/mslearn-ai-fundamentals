# Module 13: Azure AI Studio

## Lab overview

In this exercise, you will explore the Azure AI Foundry portal and learn how to create, manage, and deploy generative AI models within the Azure ecosystem. You will gain hands-on experience working with Azure AI hubs, and projects, and deploying AI models like GPT-04-Turbo.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will perform:

- Task 1: Open Azure AI Foundry portal
- Task 2: Create a Azure AI project
- Task 3: Deploy and test a generative AI model

## Exercise 1: Explore the components and tools of the Azure AI Studio

### Task 1: Open Azure AI Foundry portal

In this task, you will sign in to Azure AI Foundry portal and explore its interface, learning how to navigate the platform and access its various features for managing AI resources.

1. In a edge browser, open https://ai.azure.com and **Sign in** using your Azure credentials. The home page of Azure AI Studio looks similar to the following image:

   - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
   - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

### Task 2: Create an Azure AI Foundry Resources

In this task, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up a collaborative workspace for AI projects and configuring essential resources.

1. On the Azure AI Foundry portal home page, in the **Help** window, select **Create a project**. In Azure AI Foundry, projects are containers that help organize your work.

1. On the **Create a project** pane, enter the following:

   - Project name **Myproject<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" /> (1)**
   - Click on the dropdown for **Advanced Options (2)**.
   - Select **AI-900-Module-13-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group (3)
   - Click **Create** (4)
