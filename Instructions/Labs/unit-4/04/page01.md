# Lesson 4: Using Machine Learning to Detect Anomalies in Manufacturing

## Lesson Description:

Students will explore how real-world manufacturing problems—such as detecting 
machine failures—can be solved using machine learning tools. They will use Azure ML 
Designer to build a pipeline that detects anomalies in a dataset from a factory floor. 
Students will also explore external data storage options and simulate how a robot might 
act on the detected anomalies.

## Main Learning Goal:

Students will build a machine learning pipeline, analyze manufacturing data, and 
demonstrate how decision-making can be enhanced with ML and robotics.

## Essential Question:

How can machine learning and robotics improve problem-solving and efficiency in a 
manufacturing environment?

## Standards:

- 1.3: Identify and use applications, libraries, and packages utilized in AI and ML 
industries. 
- 4.4: Evaluate the use of a large dataset to explore a real-world scenario.

## Objectives:
- Identify and compare popular ML platforms (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud). 
- Build a ML pipeline using Azure ML Designer with a real manufacturing dataset. 
- Visualize the output of ML pipelines using Azure Explore. 
- Discuss tradeoffs of different Azure storage types. 
- Write pseudocode and Arduino code for a basic robotic system that responds to ML 
predictions.
