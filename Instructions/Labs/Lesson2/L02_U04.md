## 2L2 Lesson Plan: Human & Machine Learning

### Lesson Description:

In this lesson, students will explore how humans learn and how machines process information using algorithms. They will identify key differences between human and machine learning, including the limitations of artificial intelligence. Additionally, students will examine the role of machine learning in agriculture and engage in a debate on whether traditional or modern agriculture methods are more effective.

#### Main Learning Goal:

Students will be able to distinguish between human and machine learning and effectively articulate and defend their stance in a debate.

#### Essential Question:
How do machines learn and process information compared to humans, and are they more effective than human intelligence?

#### Standards:

•	IAI.A2.2. Explain the difference between machine learning and human learning.

#### Objectives:

•	Students will be able to distinguish between human and machine learning and explain their key differences.
•	Students will be able to describe and analyze the "Sense-Deliberate-Act" process used by machines.
•	Students will be able to recognize and categorize real-world examples of both human and machine learning.
•	Students will be able to evaluate the strengths and limitations of each learning type.
•	Students will develop critical thinking and debate skills, effectively defending their stance using evidence-based arguments.

### Total Duration: 140 – 160 minutes (3 days)

#### Important Vocabulary:
1.	Learning:
a.	Definition: The process of gaining new knowledge, skills, or behaviors through experience, practice, or observation. It is shown by changes in behavior, understanding, or brain function.
b.	Example: Learning to ride a bike by practicing multiple times
2.	Machine Learning (ML):
a.	Definition: A branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.
b.	Example: A spam filter learns to identify junk emails based on previous flagged messages
3.	Algorithm:
a.	Definition: A step-by-step set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task or solve a problem.
b.	Example: A recipe for baking a cake, where each step must be followed in order.
4.	Data Training:
a.	Definition: The process of feeding large amounts of labeled or structured data into a machine learning model so it can recognize patterns and make accurate predictions.
b.	Example: Teaching an AI to recognize cats by showing it thousands of cat photos.
5.	Pattern Recognition:
a.	Definition: The ability to detect recurring structures, trends, or characteristics in data.
b.	Example: Noticing that traffic is always heavier at certain times of the day.
6.	Cognition:
a.	Definition: The mental process of thinking, understanding, learning, and remembering.
b.	Example: Solving a math problem by breaking it down into smaller steps.
7.	Intuition:
a.	Definition: The ability to understand something immediately, without needing conscious reasoning or extensive data analysis.
b.	Example Knowing someone is upset just by looking at their facial expression.
8.	Critical Thinking:
a.	Definition: The ability to analyze information, assess different perspectives, and make reasoned decisions.
b.	Example: Reading a news article and questioning whether the source is reliable.
9.	Automation:
a.	Definition: The use of technology, machines, or AI to perform tasks with minimal human intervention.
b.	Example: A washing machine automatically stops when the cycle is complete.
