#### Storyline

In this lesson, students will explore how humans learn and how machines process information using algorithms. They will identify key differences between human and machine learning, including the limitations of artificial intelligence. Additionally, students will examine the role of machine learning in agriculture and engage in a debate on whether traditional or modern agriculture methods are more effective.

#### Main Learning Goal

Students will be able to distinguish between human and machine learning and effectively articulate and defend their stance in a debate.

#### Focus Question

How do machines learn and process information compared to humans, and are they more effective than human intelligence?
