## L11 Lesson Plan: Hardware and Software for AI in Agriculture
### Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore how AI systems are packaged and scaled for agriculture. They will learn that a small-scale AI project—such as a sensor-based system running on a laptop—requires a minimal hardware/software footprint, while large-scale corporate AI solutions demand robust infrastructure, including data centers, GPUs, satellite data, and advanced cloud platforms. This lesson sets the stage by comparing the two approaches, preparing students to appreciate the spectrum of solutions and the challenges of scaling up.

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will understand the differences in hardware and software requirements for small-scale versus large-scale AI solutions in agriculture and learn when each type of system is appropriate.

### Essential Question:
How do hardware and software requirements change when scaling an AI solution from a small project to a large corporate farm?

### Standards:

•	IAI.A1.1: Identify and relate how hardware and software are used within given AI solutions. 

### Objectives:

•	Explain the components required for a small-scale AI project (e.g., a laptop, basic sensors, Bluetooth, Python environment).  

•	Identify additional hardware/software needs for large-scale corporate AI solutions (e.g., data centers, GPUs, satellite data, enterprise cloud platforms).  

•	Compare and contrast the requirements of small-scale and large-scale systems.    

•	Discuss when a minimal hardware/software footprint is sufficient and when more robust infrastructure is needed.

### Engage (Elicit/Develop) ~ 5 minutes
#### Activity Name: Day One - Small-Scale AI Systems in Agriculture (~5 minutes)

Activity Walkthrough: 

1.	The teacher will facilitate a classroom discussion.

    a.	**Q1: What hardware and software components would you need for a small-scale AI project on a laptop?**

    Mention that we’d want an affordable laptop or PC to store and analyze data, soil moisture and temperature sensors to collect data, and a Python programming environment to read and process this data.  

2.	The teacher may then explain what would be needed to scale up the same system for hundreds of greenhouses, or a large corporate farm. 

    a.	These farms use:   

    i.	Cloud storage (to store huge amounts of data from sensors and satellites) 

    ii.	High-speed computers with powerful processors (GPUs) (to quickly analyze large sets of farm data) 

    iii.	Wireless networks (to connect thousands of sensors and drones)  '

    iv.	AI programs (to track weather, predict crop growth, and manage watering systems automatically)

3.	The teacher will instruct students to answer the following questions in SREB_U3_L11_Handout_HardwareandSoftware:

    a.	**Q1: What are two examples of hardware used in a small-scale AI farm system?**

    A laptop, environmental sensors, USB and/or Bluetooth connections.

    b.	**Q2: Why is a laptop good enough for a small farm but not for a large farm?**

    A laptop can handle a small amount of data from a few sensors on a small farm, but a large farm generates too much data for a laptop to process quickly or store effectively.

    c. **Q3: How does using sensors help a small farmer make better decisions?**

    Sensors provide real-time data about soil, weather, and plant health, allowing farmers to water, fertilize, or protect crops more efficiently based on actual conditions.

### Explore (Develop/Deploy) ~ 40 minutes 
#### Activity Name: Day One - Small Scale Farm in South Carolina (~ 40 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:** 

1.	The teacher will introduce the scenario to students and explain the given dataset, **SREB_U3_L11_SmallFarmData**.

    a.	“Imagine a family-run farm in South Carolina that grows a variety of crops such as peaches, tomatoes, and green beans. The farmers want to use AI to optimize irrigation, monitor soil conditions, and improve crop yields. With the set-up previously described, they plan to use a basic setup—a laptop, a few sensors, and simple Python scripts—to analyze their data.”

    b. **Each row provides information about:**  

    i.	Farm_ID: A unique identifier for each plot.  

    ii.	Crop: The type of crop grown (e.g., Peaches, Tomatoes, Green Beans).  

    iii.	Soil_pH: The acidity or alkalinity of the soil, which affects crop growth.  

    iv.	Rainfall (inches): The amount of rainfall received.  

    v.	Temperature (°F): The average temperature in the plot.  

    vi.	Irrigation Type: The method used for watering (e.g., Drip, Pivot, Rainfed).  

    vii. Yield (tons/acre): Crop yield, an indicator of productivity.  

    viii. Fertilizer Used: Whether fertilizer was applied (Yes/No).
    
2.	The teacher will then instruct students to open the Python notebook **SREB_U3_L11_Notebook**.

    a.	The completed version for teacher guidance is named **SREB_U3_L11_Notebook_Completed**.

    b.	Before continuing, ensure students understand that they need to write their code in the tagged code blocks and press play afterwards, as seen in figure 1 below. 

    ![](../media/ag151.png)

    c.	Students will also need to have downloaded the CSV file on the same folder that the notebook is running from.  

3.	The teacher will guide students through Step 1 and Step 2 of the coding analysis. 

    a.	**Step 1: Loading**

    i.	The main detail to get across is that we are using the python module csv to help us get information from the dataset. We open the file, skip the header, and then store each row in our variable ‘data’. ‘Data’ can be thought of as a list of lists.  

    b.	**Step 2: Cleaning** 

    i.	The main detail to get across is that our data is stored initially as text (otherwise called strings) unless we tell the program otherwise. For example, in Excel, we would simply change the data type to “Number”. This step is essentially doing the same for the given columns. Students should understand that we cannot do math operations on this data unless we mark it as a number.

    
    c.	Resource: RealPython: [Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python](https://realpython.com/python-csv/)
    
4.	The teacher will continue to guide students through steps 3 and 4.

    a.	**Step 3: Calculating Average** 

    i.	The main detail to get across is the ease of average calculation using list comprehension and the sum function. We then print these values out, which students will see once they run this code. 

    ii.	Resource: [W3 Schools: Python - List Comprehension](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp)

    b.	**Step 4: Warning Statements** 

    i.	The main detail to get across is the concept of conditional logic (i.e., if this statement is true, then do this action). We use conditional logic to check if the soil pH is too low, or if the rainfall is too high, and if either is true, we will print out statements with a small warning message. Students will also see these statements once they run the code block.
