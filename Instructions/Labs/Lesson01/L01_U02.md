L1 Lesson Plan: The Evolution of Agriculture
Lesson Description:
In this unit, you'll explore how modern agriculture relies on technology, data, and artificial intelligence to feed the world more efficiently. We'll begin by looking at how farming has evolved from traditional methods to high-tech systems, and why this transformation matters. You’ll learn how humans and machines process information differently, how data is collected and analyzed on farms, and how artificial intelligence helps farmers make smarter decisions. 
As we move through each lesson, you’ll discover how to use real-world tools like sensors, spreadsheets, and even Python code to understand and solve agricultural problems. You'll also get to explore different types of machine learning, understand the difference between explainable and black box AI, and examine how data influences farm design and operations. 
At the end of the unit, you’ll apply everything you've learned by designing and building your own smart farm using Arduino technology. You’ll collect sensor data, analyze it, and make improvements to your farm system—just like real engineers and data scientists. This unit is all about hands-on learning, critical thinking, and solving real-world challenges in agriculture with modern tools.
