### Task 2: Use automated machine learning to train a model

Automated machine learning enables you to try multiple algorithms and parameters to train multiple models, and identify the best one for your data. In this exercise, you'll use a dataset of historical bicycle rental details to train a model that predicts the number of bicycle rentals that should be expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological features.

1. Submit the training job. It starts automatically.

1. Wait for the job to finish. It might take a while — now might be a good time for a coffee break!

  ## Review the best model

When the automated machine learning job has completed, you can review the best model it trained.

1. On the **Overview** tab of the automated machine learning job, note the best model summary.

    ![](media/lab1-2.png)

    > **Note**
    > You may see a message under the status "Warning: User specified exit score reached...". This is an expected message. Please continue to the next step.
  
1. Select the text under **Algorithm name** for the best model to view its details.

1. Select the **Metrics** tab and select the **residuals** and **predicted_true** charts if they are not already selected. 

    Review the charts which show the performance of the model. The **residuals** chart shows the *residuals* (the differences between predicted and actual values) as a histogram. The **predicted_true** chart compares the predicted values against the true values.

### Task 3: Deploy and test the model

1. On the **Model** tab for the best model trained by your automated machine learning job, select **Deploy** and use the **Web service** option to deploy the model with the following settings:
    - **Name**: predict-rentals  **(1)**
    - **Description**: Predict cycle rentals **(2)**
    - **Compute type**: Azure Container Instance **(3)**
    - **Enable authentication**: *Selected* **(4)**
    - Select **Deploy**

     ![](media/lab1-4.png)

1. Wait for the deployment to start - this may take a few seconds. The **Deploy status** for the **predict-rentals** endpoint will be indicated in the main part of the page as *Running*.
1. Wait for the **Deploy status** to change to *Succeeded*. This may take 5-10 minutes.
   
## Task 4: Test the deployed service

Now you can test your deployed service.

1. In Azure Machine Learning studio, on the left hand menu, select **Endpoints** and open the **predict-rentals** real-time endpoint.

1. On the **predict-rentals** real-time endpoint page view the **Test** tab.

1. In the **Input data to test endpoint** pane, replace the template JSON with the following input data:

    ```JSON
    {
      "Inputs": { 
        "data": [
          {
            "day": 1,
            "mnth": 1,   
            "year": 2022,
            "season": 2,
            "holiday": 0,
            "weekday": 1,
            "workingday": 1,
            "weathersit": 2, 
            "temp": 0.3, 
            "atemp": 0.3,
            "hum": 0.3,
            "windspeed": 0.3 
          }
        ]    
      },   
      "GlobalParameters": 1.0
    }
    ```

1. Click the **Test** button.

1. Review the test results, which include a predicted number of rentals based on the input features - similar to this:

    ```JSON
    {
      "Results": [
        444.27799000000000
      ]
    }
    ```

    The test pane took the input data and used the model you trained to return the predicted number of rentals.

Let's review what you have done. You used a dataset of historical bicycle rental data to train a model. The model predicts the number of bicycle rentals expected on a given day, based on seasonal and meteorological *features*.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
 
- Navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
- Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task. 
- If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
