## L10 Lesson Plan: Structured vs Unstructured Data & Data
### Lesson Description:
In this lesson, students will explore structured vs. unstructured data, their roles in agriculture, and how they are processed into valuable insights. They will also examine how data influences the design, implementation, and review of agricultural programs, driving smarter strategies and more efficient resource management.  

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will break down the tasks associated with working with data in agriculture and the impact it has on design, implementation and review of programs.  

### Essential Question:
How can various types of data be processed and transformed into valuable insights, and how do they influence the design, implementation, and evaluation of agricultural programs?  

### Standards:

•	IAI.C2.1 Decompose and explain tasks associated with given data sets (e.g., limited data libraries) into smaller, reusable parts to facilitate the design, implementation, and review of programs.

### Objectives:

•	Students will be able to describe the differences between structured and unstructured data 

•	Students will understand the importance of both structured and unstructured data in improving efficiency and innovation in agriculture 

•	Students will analyze how data influences the design, implementation, and review of agricultural programs


### Total Duration: 50 minutes (1 day)

#### Important Vocabulary:

1.	Structured Data
a.	Definition: Data that has a standardized format for efficient access by software and humans alike.
b.	Example: A customer database storing names, addresses, and purchase history
2.	Unstructured Data
a.	Definition: Information, in many different forms, that doesn't follow conventional data models, making it difficult to store and manage in a mainstream relational database.
b.	Example: Photos, videos, and social media posts
3.	Data Decomposition
a.	Definition: The process of breaking down large, complex datasets into smaller, more manageable components for analysis and processing
b.	Example: Splitting a company-wide sales report into separate reports for each region
4.	Data Cleaning
a.	Definition: The process of correcting, removing, or handling errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in a dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability
b.	Example: Removing duplicates from a data set
5.	Normalization
a.	Definition: A technique used to standardize and scale numerical data to a consistent range
b.	Example: Converting grades from a 100-point scale to a 4.0 GPA scale
6.	Computer Vision
a.	Definition: A branch of AI that enables machines to analyze and interpret visual data from images or videos
b.	Example: Model that identifies dog breeds from images
7.	Natural Language Processing (NLP)
a.	Definition: A field of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language
b.	Example:  A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa responding to voice commands
8.	Time-Series Analysis
a.	Definition: A method of analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals to identify trends, patterns, and forecasts
b.	Example: Tracking daily stock prices to predict market trends
