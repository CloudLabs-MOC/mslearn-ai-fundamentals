(Un)Structured Data 
As data engineers, we've worked with a variety of data throughout this class—exploring numerical and categorical types and learning how to process them effectively. But what happens when data doesn’t fit neatly into these categories?
Let’s explore that and see how we can use other forms of data to design, implement, and improve our agricultural models!

Based on the definitions of “data,” “structured,” and “unstructured,” identify whether the following examples are structured data, unstructured data, or not data at all.
Payment form                                                                                     __________________________
A junk drawer full of random objects                                    __________________________
Social media posts                                                                          __________________________
Email content                                                                                     __________________________
A fridge full of groceries                                                               __________________________
Customer database                                                                        __________________________

How is structured data decomposed into useful information?



What types of unstructured data do you think exists in agriculture?
