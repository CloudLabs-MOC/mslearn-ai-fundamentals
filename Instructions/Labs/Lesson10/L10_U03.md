### How Well Do We Know Data? ~ 5 minutes

Throughout this class, we've talked a lot about data, but what exactly qualifies as data?

By definition, data is factual information (such as measurements or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation.

We’ve also explored data types like numerical and categorical, but now let’s take it a step further: What do we think structured and unstructured data are?

As common definitions:

- Structured means construct or arrange according to a plan; give a pattern or organization to.

- Unstructured means not formally organized in a set or conventional pattern.

Let’s take a look at the **SREB_U3_L10_Handout_(Un)StructuredData** handout, and complete a quick activity.

**Based on the definitions of “data,” “structured,” and “unstructured,” identify whether the following examples are structured data, unstructured data, or not data at all**.

Email content                                                                                     __________________________

A fridge full of groceries                                                               __________________________

Customer database                                                                        __________________________


Now, answer the following questions: 

1. **Now is structured data decomposed into useful information?**

2. **What types of unstructured data do you think exists in agriculture?**

### Structured Data 

All the data we’ve worked on so far has been clearly defined, structured data.
Structured Data is data that has a standardized format for efficient access by software and humans alike. It is typically tabular with rows and columns that clearly define data attributes. [source]
So far, we’ve explored several examples of structured data used in agriculture, including:

- Crop yield data – Crop type, yield, year planted
- Weather data – Date, location, temperature, rainfall, humidity
- Soil health – Soil pH, nitrogen levels, moisture content, soil type
- Market & Sales Data – Product, quantity sold, market price, total revenue
Raw data, like the provided table, isn’t very useful on its own. 

**Consider the following question: What are different ways we can process and refine this data to make it more useful?**

Structured data is highly organized, easily searchable, and efficiently processed, making it a valuable tool in agriculture for optimizing operations, improving decision-making, and increasing productivity.

However, the majority of data is unstructured, so how can we process and extract value from it?

### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is information, in many different forms, that doesn't follow conventional data models, making it difficult to store and manage in a mainstream relational database. [source]

Unlike structured data, it lacks a fixed format, making it more difficult to store, manage, and analyze using conventional tools like Excel. Instead, we rely on advanced technologies like machine learning and AI to process and extract meaningful insights.

**Consider the following question: What types of unstructured data do you think exist in agriculture?**

Some examples include:

- Drone and satellite imagery – Used to monitor crop health, detect pests, analyze soil conditions, etc.

- Farmer and field notes – Handwritten or digital observations

- Weather reports and forecasts – Raw meteorological reports

- Customer and market sentiment data – Consumer trends, online reviews, social media insights


Various machine learning and AI models can be used to process unstructured data effectively. For example, computer vision can analyze images, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can extract insights from text or handwritten notes, or time-series analysis can examine real-time data to make predictions and optimize decision-making.

Unstructured data accounts for nearly 80% of all data generated today, capturing the complexity of real-world information in ways structured data cannot. With AI and machine learning, this raw information can be processed into actionable knowledge, driving advancements in precision farming, sustainability, and efficiency.

Both structured and unstructured data play a crucial role in shaping the design, implementation, and review of agricultural programs. Structured data provides clear, organized insights that allow for precise planning and measurable outcomes. Meanwhile, unstructured data captures complex, real-world conditions, enabling AI-driven decision-making for better predictions and adaptive farming strategies.

When designing an agricultural initiative:

- Structured soil data can help determine which crops grow best in certain regions

- Unstructured satellite data can identify soil erosion patterns or pest hot spots in the identified regions

After producing a plan, data can help implement the plan by:

- Efficiently allocating resources, such as pesticides, only where needed based on structured data

- Taking precautionary measures from AI predicted weather from unstructured data


Continuous evaluation and review are needed to improve the program after implementation:

- Structured yield and profitability reports compare expected vs actual crop yields, identifying successes and inefficiencies

- Unstructured data used in machine learning forecasting can predict future agricultural challenges

Now that we have established each step, refer to the **SREB_U3_L10_Handout_(Un)StructuredData** handout and complete the following activity:

**Provide an example of how structured and unstructured data are used in the design, implementation, and review process for agricultural programs**.

By combining structured and unstructured data, agricultural professionals can design smarter programs, implement adaptive, data-driven strategies, and continuously refine and improve their plan.


### Wrap Up

We’ve explored how structured and unstructured data shape agricultural decision-making and how AI helps process raw information into valuable insights. Now, let’s take a step back and reflect on what we’ve learned.

- **How do structured and unstructured data each contribute to decision-making in agriculture?**

- **How do AI and machine learning help make unstructured data more useful?**

- **If you were designing a data-driven agricultural program, what type of data would you prioritize, and why?**
