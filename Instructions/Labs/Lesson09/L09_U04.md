### Standards:

- IAI.B3.1 Analyze the use of appropriate data types (e.g., lists, arrays, and 2D arrays) in simple programs.

### Objectives:

- Learn fundamental Python programming concepts. 

- Understand basic data types and their role in storing and computing data. 

- See how lists and 2D arrays (tables) store structured data. 

- Work with CSV files to import, analyze, and store agricultural data. 

- Discover how these Python data structures can support AI and help make decisions in agriculture.

### Storyline

Students begin by diving into the fundamentals of Python programming. They start with the basics: learning about variables, data types like integers, floats, and strings, and then move on to understanding lists and 2D arrays. As they master these key concepts, they see how they can be applied to manage and analyze real-world agricultural data from a CSV file, making the learning process both practical and relevant.

### Main Learning Goal

Students will be able to learn basic Python programming to organize and analyze agricultural data using lists and arrays. This will equip them with the skills necessary to manage both small programs and larger data tasks effectively.

### Focus Question
How can Python and different data types help store and analyze agricultural data efficiently?

### Tables
