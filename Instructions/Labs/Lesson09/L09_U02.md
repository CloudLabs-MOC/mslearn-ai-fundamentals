## L9 Lesson Plan: Data Types in Programs
### Lesson Description:
In this lesson, we are starting with the very basics of Python programming. We will learn about fundamental building blocks like variables, data types (integers, floats, strings), lists, and 2D arrays. Then, we will see how these ideas help us manage and analyze real-world agricultural data from a CSV file.

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will be able to learn basic Python programming to organize and analyze agricultural data using lists and arrays. This will equip them with the skills necessary to manage both small programs and larger data tasks effectively.

### Essential Question:

How can Python and different data types help store and analyze agricultural data efficiently?  

### Standards:

•	IAI.B3.1 Analyze the use of appropriate data types (e.g., lists, arrays, and 2D arrays) in simple programs.  

### Objectives:

•	Learn fundamental Python programming concepts.  

•	Understand basic data types and their role in storing and computing data.  

•	See how lists and 2D arrays (tables) store structured data.  

•	Work with CSV files to import, analyze, and store agricultural data.

•	Discover how these Python data structures can support AI and help make decisions in agriculture.
