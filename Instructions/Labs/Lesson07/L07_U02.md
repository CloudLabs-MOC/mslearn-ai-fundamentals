### Engage (Elicit/Develop) ~ 55 minutes

#### Activity Name: Introduction to Machine Learning (~40 minutes)
Activity Walkthrough: 
Students will revisit the basics of Machine Learning by comparing it to human learning. They will understand how humans learn from a few examples. The activity will include exploring the four types of ML with real-world farming examples, emphasizing that different tasks need different ML approaches.

1.	The teacher will recap what we have learned about Machine Learning (ML) and how it differs from human learning.

    a.	The teacher will explain what Machine Learning using a hypothetical scenario to show how humans learn from examples and experience.

    - Machine Learning is a branch of AI where computers learn from data instead of being programmed with specific instructions. 

    - Imagine you have a pet dog. If you show your younger siblings a dog and say, “This is a dog,” they will remember the features—it has four legs, fur, a tail, and it barks. Later, if they see another dog, they will recognize it even if it's a different breed. 

    Students will understand how humans learn from examples and experience.

    b.	The teacher will continue explaining now the differences between human learning vs. Machine learning. Humans recognize patterns and adapt quickly based on a few examples. 

    - AI, on the other hand, analyzes large amounts of data to find patterns. 
    - Think about how we teach a child what a dog looks like—humans need just a few examples, but AI needs thousands of labeled images before it can identify a dog accurately.

2. The teacher will explain in detail the four types of machine learning, emphasizing that ML is not a one-size-fits-all solution—different AI tasks require different ML approaches for optimal results.
Students will pay attention to the teacher's explanation of the different types of machine learning and use the Machine Learning Type Table in **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout** to follow along.

    a.	Explain what Supervised Learning (Guided Learning) is, how it works, and provide examples from farming, along with a human learning analogy.  

    - **What is it?** 

        i. AI learns from labeled examples (it is “supervised” like a student in class). 

        ii.	AI knows the right answers during training and tries to make predictions.
     
    - **How it works:** 

        i. AI is given a dataset with correct answers (e.g., a list of plant images labeled “Healthy” or “Sick”). 

        ii.	AI finds patterns between features (color, leaf spots, dryness) and labels.

        iii. AI is tested with new plant images to see if it can correctly classify them. 

    - **Example in Farming:** 

        AI for Plant Disease Detection 

        i.	AI shows 10,000 images of crops labeled "Healthy" or "Diseased." 

        ii.	AI learns what a sick plant looks like. 

        iii. When given a new plant image, AI predicts if it’s sick or healthy! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:** 

        i.	Imagine you are learning math. A teacher shows examples and gives you the correct answers first. 

        ii. Later, when you solve problems on your own, you apply the patterns you learned! Answer

    b.	Explain what Unsupervised Learning (Self-Discovery) is, how it works, and provide examples from farming, along with a human learning analogy.

    - **What is it?**

        i.	AI is given data without labels—it must find patterns by itself. 

        ii.	AI groups similar things together without knowing what they are. 

    - **How it works:** 

        i.	AI looks at many farm images but isn’t told what’s in them. 

        ii.	AI notices similarities (color, shape, size) and groups similar items together. 

        iii. AI can organize and cluster the data even without labels! 

    - Example in Farming: 

        AI Sorting Crops by Type 

        i.	AI looks at 10,000 crop images (wheat, corn, rice) but has no labels.

        ii.	It groups wheat together, corn together, and rice together based on similarities. 

        iii.	Farmers later label the groups, and AI becomes more accurate over time! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:** 

        i.	Imagine you visit a school cafeteria for the first time.

        ii.	You notice groups of students sitting together—athletes, musicians, gamers.

        iii. Even though no one told you, you figured out patterns and grouped them!

    c.	Explain what Reinforcement Learning (Trial & Error Learning) is, how it works, and provide examples from farming, along with a human learning analogy.  

    - **What is it?** 

        i.	AI learns by trying things, making mistakes, and getting rewards or penalties. 

        ii.	AI improves over time by figuring out the best way to achieve a goal. 

    - How it works: 

        i. AI takes an action (e.g., moving a tractor forward). 

        ii.	AI sees if the action was good or bad (avoided or hit an obstacle). 

        iii. AI adjusts based on rewards (success) or penalties (mistakes). 

    - **Example in Farming:** 

        AI for Self-Driving Tractors 

        i.	AI controls a smart tractor moving through a farm.

        ii.	If AI avoids obstacles → AI gets a reward. 

        iii. If AI hits an obstacle → AI gets a penalty. 

        iv.	Over time, AI learns the best path to move efficiently! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:** 

        i.	When learning to ride a bike, you might fall at first.

        ii.	After each fall, you adjust your balance until you master riding.

    d.	Explain what Transfer Learning (Learning from Experience) is, how it works, and provide examples from farming, along with a human learning analogy.

    - **What is it?** 

        i.	AI applies knowledge from one task to a new but similar task. 

        ii.	Saves time because AI doesn’t start from scratch. 

    - **How it works:** 

        i.	AI learns to detect plant diseases in wheat. 

        ii.	AI uses the same learning to detect diseases in corn without full retraining. 

        iii. AI adapts quickly and works efficiently with new crops! 

    - **Example in Farming:** 

        AI for Disease Detection in Multiple Crops 

        i.	AI was trained on wheat disease images. 

        ii.	AI can now detect corn diseases with very little new training! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:** 

        i.	If you already know how to ride a scooter, learning to ride a bike is easier!

    e.	Summarize the four ML types, and how farming uses ML. Consider the following points.

    - Supervised Learning – AI learns from labeled examples. Farming uses this type of ML to detect diseases. 

    - Unsupervised Learning – AI finds patterns without labels. Farming uses this type of ML to group crops. 

    - Reinforcement Learning – AI learns from trial & error. Farming uses this type of ML to optimize irrigation. 

    - Transfer Learning – AI applies past knowledge to new tasks. Farming uses this type of ML to adapt AI models to new crops.

3.	Students should consider the following questions, and answer them in their **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout**:

    a.	Q1: How is Supervised Learning similar to how humans learn with a teacher?

    b.	Q2: Why might farmers use Unsupervised Learning instead of Supervised Learning? 

    c.	Q3: How does Reinforcement Learning help AI improve over time?

    d.	Q4: Why is Transfer Learning useful for detecting diseases in different crops?

#### Activity #2 Name: AI Learning Puzzle - Sort & Solve (~15 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:** 

Students will work in small groups to solve a Machine Learning puzzle by arranging scrambled steps for Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning. They will discuss their reasoning, organize the steps for each ML type, and explain how the sequence helps AI learn effectively.  

1.	The teacher will ask students to form small groups or pairs to solve a machine learning puzzle.

    a.	The teacher will explain step-by-step Instructions: 

    - Each group receives a mixed-up set of learning steps for all four Machine Learning types. 

    - Sort the steps into what they believe is the correct sequence. 

    - Discuss the reasoning behind their choices: 

        i.	Q1: What clues did they use to arrange the steps? 

        ii.	Q2: How does this order help AI learn properly? 

    - Write their final order.

    The student mission is to arrange the steps in the correct order and explain their reasoning.

2.	The teacher will provide the following Scrambled AI Learning Steps for students to organize.  

    a.	Supervised Learning – AI Learns with Labels 
    - AI makes predictions on new plant images based on learned patterns. 
    - AI receives a dataset of labeled plant images ("Healthy" or "Diseased"). 
    - AI compares its predictions with the actual labels and refines its accuracy over time. 
    - AI analyzes patterns (e.g., leaf color, spots, dryness) in the labeled images. 

    **Clue:** This type of learning is like a teacher giving examples before letting students try it on their own.

    b. Unsupervised Learning – AI Groups Similar Data Without Labels 

    - Farmers review AI-created groups and add meaningful labels (e.g., "high pH," "low moisture"). 
    - AI detects patterns and automatically groups similar soils together. 
    - AI is given thousands of unlabeled soil samples. 
    - AI refines its grouping, making soil classification more accurate over time. 

        **Clue:** AI is not given any answers—it has to find patterns on its own. 

    c.	Reinforcement Learning – AI Learns by Trial and Error 

    - AI begins controlling an irrigation system with random watering amounts. 
    - AI adjusts its watering decisions based on past successes and mistakes. 
    - Over time, AI optimizes irrigation schedules for healthier crops. 
    - AI receives feedback: If crops are too dry, it gets a penalty; if water is optimal, it gets a reward. 

        **Clue:** This type of learning is like playing a video game—AI gets better by trial and error. 

    d.	Transfer Learning – AI Applies Knowledge to a New Problem 

    - AI is first trained in detecting wheat diseases. 
    - AI applies its wheat knowledge to detect corn diseases without full retraining. 
    - Farmers now use AI to identify diseases in multiple crops with minimal adjustments. 
    - AI is given a small dataset of diseased corn plants to analyze. 

        **Clue:** AI is reusing its knowledge instead of starting from scratch.

### Explore Pt.1 (Develop) ~ 45 minutes 
### Activity Name: How AI Helps Farmers (~45 minutes)
**Activity Walkthrough:** 

Students will understand how AI uses Machine Learning in farming through real-world applications, learn about the data required for each ML method, analyze real datasets.

1. The teacher will start with an introduction of how AI helps farmers.

    a.	Start a class discussion with the following questions. 

    - **Q1: What are some of the biggest challenges that farmers face?** 

        Possible Answers:  

        i.	Weather unpredictability 

        ii.	Plant diseases   
        iii.	Soil health  
        iv.	Water usage  
        v.	Crop yield prediction  

    - **Q2: How do you think AI could help solve these problems?**  

        Possible Answer:  

        i.	Farmers today use Machine Learning to analyze data and make better decisions—just like humans learn from past experiences, AI learns from farm data to improve agriculture.

2.	The teacher will explain how machine learning is used in farming. 

    a.	Consider the following step-by-step explanation of how AI works in agriculture.

    - Collecting Data – AI uses soil sensors, weather stations, and satellite images to gather information. 
    - Processing Data – AI analyzes trends and patterns in data using Machine Learning models. 
    - Making Predictions – AI predicts weather changes, crop diseases, and optimal harvest times. 
    - Taking Action – AI automatically adjusts irrigation, pest control, or crop schedules based on the analysis.

3.	The teacher will provide a deeper explanation of how machine learning works in agriculture with datasets.

    a.	For Supervised Learning – Detecting Plant Diseases, explain and use:

    - Use the Dataset Example of Healthy or Diseased in Table 1 in the Main Page.

    - **Explain how it works:**  

        i.	AI is trained on thousands of images of sick and healthy plants. It learns to identify disease symptoms based on color changes, leaf spots, and dryness. When new plant images are given, then AI can correctly classify them as either healthy or diseased.

    - **Explain the AI Processing Steps:**  

        i.	AI analyzes the dataset and learns that yellow or brown leaves with spots are likely diseased.

        ii.	AI scans new plant images and classifies them based on past learning. 

        iii. Farmers use this AI tool on their phones to instantly detect plant diseases in the field.

    b.	For Unsupervised Learning – Grouping Crops by Soil Type, explain and use:

    - Use the Dataset Example of Cluster Group in Table 2 in the Main Page.
    - **Explain how it works:** 

        i.	AI analyzes soil quality data but is not given any pre-set labels. It clusters soil types based on patterns in the data. Farmers then use this clustered data to decide which crops will grow best in different soil types.

    - **Explain the AI processing steps:** 

        i.	AI analyzes soil samples based on pH, moisture, and nitrogen levels. 

        ii.	AI groups similar soils together into categories (A, B, C).   

        iii. Farmers then plant different crops based on the AI-generated soil category.

    c.	For Reinforcement Learning – Smart Irrigation Systems, explain and use:

    - Use the Dataset Example of Crop Health Rating in Table 3 in the Main Page.

    - **Explain how it works:**   

        i.	AI adjusts watering schedules based on real-time soil moisture data. If AI over-waters, it learns to reduce water usage. If it is underwater, it corrects its decision for the next cycle.

    - **Explain the AI Processing Steps:** 
        i.	AI analyzes crop health based on soil moisture and irrigation amount.

        ii.	AI learns from mistakes (overwatering makes plants unhealthy). 

        iii. AI adjusts future irrigation schedules to maximize crop health with minimal water waste.

    d. For Transfer Learning – AI Adapting to Different Crops, explain and use:

    - Use the AI Confidence Dataset Example in Table 4 in the Main Page.

    - **Explain how it works:** 

        i.	AI that was originally trained to detect diseases in wheat can quickly learn to detect diseases in corn. This saves time because the AI does not need to start from scratch. 

    - **Explain the AI Processing Steps:** 

        i. AI was trained on wheat diseases first.

        ii.	AI uses this knowledge to detect diseases in corn and other crops.   
        iii. Farmers save time and effort because AI does not need to be retrained from scratch.
4. The teacher will facilitate an exit ticket activity. Students will consider the following question:

    a. **Q1: Which Machine Learning type do you think is the most useful in farming, and why?**

### Explore Pt. 2 (Deploy) ~45 minutes
#### Activity Name: Preparing for the Gallery Walk Poster Activity (~45 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

Students form small groups, each assigned an ML type to create a visual poster that includes its definition, required data, and an example of how it helps farmers.

1.	The teacher will assign one of the four types of machine learning to each group and explain the poster requirements where each group creates a visual poster that includes:   

    i.	Q1: Definition of their ML type.   
    ii.	Q2: What kind of data does it need? (Labeled, unlabeled, real-time).   
    iii.	Q3: Example of how it helps farmers.   
    iv.	Q4: Why is it important in agriculture?

2.	The teacher will wrap up the lesson and have students reflect on this question.

    a.	**Q1: Which Machine Learning type do you think is the most useful in farming, and why?**

#### Activity #2 Name: AI Concepts in Agriculture (~20 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

This session will introduce students to key AI concepts and how they apply them to farming. The focus is on making these topics engaging and easy to understand with real-world agricultural examples.  Then, students will actively participate in a recap discussion led by the teacher, reinforcing their understanding of AI's role in improving farming practices.

1.	The teacher will introduce students to key AI concepts, providing their definitions and demonstrating each with real-world examples, as well as examples from the farming industry.

    a. Explain what an Algorithm is.

    - Definition: 

        i. An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions that AI follows to solve a problem. It tells AI what to do and in what order. 

    - Real-World Example: 

        Think about baking a cake—you follow specific steps in order: 

        i.	Gather ingredients 

        ii.	Mix the batter 

        iii.	Bake at the right temperature 

        iv.	Let it cool before eating 

    If the steps are out of order (like baking before mixing!), the cake will be ruined. AI works the same way—it needs precise instructions to function correctly. 

    - Farming Example: 

      AI detecting plant diseases follows an algorithm: 

        i.	Capture an image of the plant. 

        ii.	Analyze for signs of disease (yellow leaves, brown spots, etc.). 

        iii.	Compare the signs to known plant diseases. 

        iv.	Recommend treatment to the farmer.

        In the **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout**, answer the following: 

        **Q1: What type of Machine Learning is being used in this case? Why?**  

    b. Explain what Sequence and Iteration in AI is. 

    - Definition: 

        i.	Sequence = The order of steps AI follows.

        ii.	Iteration = AI repeats tasks, learning from past actions to improve. 

    - Real-World Example: 

      Imagine a farmer’s daily routine: 

        i.	Check soil moisture.

        ii.	Water crops if needed.

        iii.	Check for pests. 

        iv.	Harvest crops.

        If these steps aren’t done in sequence, problems may arise (e.g., watering before checking soil moisture might waste water). 

    - **Farming Example:**

      AI learning to irrigate a farm uses iteration: 

        i. Day 1: AI waters too much, crops are flooded. 

        ii.	Day 2: AI adjusts and waters a little less. 

        iii. Day 3: AI finds the perfect amount of water for healthy crops. 

    **Key Learning:** AI repeats actions to improve over time—just like farmers learn from experience!

    c.	Explain what Data Processing Cycle is.

    - Definition: 

        i.	AI follows a cycle to analyze data and make smart decisions. 

        ii.	Collect Data → Process Data → Analyze Data → Make a Decision 

    - **Real-World Example:** 

      Imagine a weather app predicting rain: 

        i.	Collect: AI gathers temperature, humidity, and wind speed data. 

        ii.	Process: It cleans the data (removing incorrect readings). 

        iii.	Analyze: AI finds patterns—higher humidity + dark clouds = rain is likely.

        iv.	Decision: The app alerts users to carry an umbrella. 

    - **Farming Example:** 

      An AI-powered irrigation system follows the same cycle: 

        i.	Collect: Sensors measure soil moisture and temperature. 

        ii.	Process: AI removes outlier data (e.g., faulty readings). 

        iii. Analyze: AI checks if soil is dry and compares it to past data.

        iv.	Decision: If soil moisture is below 30%, AI activates irrigation.

    d.	Explain what Conditionals in AI (If- Then Decisions) are.  

    - **Definition:** 

        i. AI makes IF-THEN decisions, just like humans! 

    - **Real-World Example:** 

        i. IF it rains, THEN bring an umbrella. 

        ii.	IF it’s cold, THEN wear a jacket.  

    - **Farming Example:**

       Farmers make IF-THEN decisions every day: 

        i.	IF soil moisture is below 30%, THEN water the plants. 

        ii.	IF a plant has yellow spots, THEN AI suggests adding nutrients. 

        **Why is this important?**

        AI automates farming by following these rules. Instead of farmers manually checking each plant, AI monitors everything and alerts farmers when action is needed.

    e.	Explain what Pattern Recognition in AI is.  

    - **Definition:** 

        i.	AI learns by finding patterns in large amounts of data. 

    - **Real-World Example:** 

      **Spotify & Netflix recommendations:**

        i. If you listen to pop music, Spotify suggests similar songs. 

        ii.	If you watch action movies, Netflix recommends more action films. 

    - **Farming Example:** 

      AI analyzing plant diseases follows this process: 

        i. It studies thousands of plant images (healthy vs. diseased). 

        ii.	It finds patterns (yellow leaves, brown spots = disease). 

        iii. It applies this knowledge to new plants to detect disease. 

        **Why is this important?** 

        Instead of farmers inspecting every plant manually, AI quickly scans fields and finds diseases faster!

    f. Explain what Bias in AI Models are. 

    - **Definition:**

      i. AI can be biased if it only learns from limited data. 

    - **Real-World Example:** 

      Imagine training a self-driving car only in sunny weather.  

      i. The car might fail in the rain because it never learned about wet roads! 

    - **Farming Example:** 

       If an AI disease detection model is only trained on wheat crops, it might: 

        i.	Accurately detect wheat diseases. 

        ii.	Misdiagnose diseases in corn or 
        soybeans. 

        **How do we fix AI bias?** 

        i.	Use diverse data (train AI on many crops, not just wheat). 

        ii.	Test AI models in different farm conditions (different weather, soil types). 

        iii. Farmers should double-check AI results before making big decisions.

2. The teacher will create a class discussion considering the following questions.  

    a. Q1: Why do farmers need AI to follow clear algorithms?   
    b.	Q2: How does AI learn from past mistakes using iteration?  
    c.	Q3: What is an example of an IF-THEN decision AI makes in farming?  
    d.	Q4: How can we reduce bias in AI farming models? 

    **Key Point:** AI helps farmers work smarter, not harder—but it is important to use good data to train AI models.

3. The teacher will initiate a discussion to recap AI in farming considering the following questions.  

    a.	Q1: What are some of the biggest ways AI helps farmers?  

    b.	Q2: Which type of Machine Learning do you think is the most useful for farmers?  

    c.	Q3: What challenges do farmers face when using AI?  

    **Possible Answers:** 

    - AI helps detect diseases early.   

    - AI predicts the best time to plant and harvest.  
    - AI automates irrigation to save water.  
    - Some farmers may struggle with AI costs or trust issues.

        Students will participate in the recap discussion and use the Machine Learning Type Table for support.


### Explain (Refine) ~ 65 minutes

    - Q2: What kind of data does it use?  
    - Q3: How does it work in farming?  
    - Q4: Why does it help farmers?  

      Encourage students to ask at least one question at each poster to keep engagement high.

3.	After the presentations, the teacher will indicate to students to fill out a Gow & Grow Sheet for feedback.

    - Glow: Q1: What did the group do well?
    - Grow: Q2: What could they improve?

4. The teacher will start a whole-class discussion. Ask the class the following questions:

    a.	Q1: Which AI model was the most useful for farming?  

    b.	Q2: What surprised you about AI in agriculture?  

    c.	Q3: What challenges might arise when implementing AI on farms? 

    **Possible answers:**   

    i. Reinforcement Learning was really cool because it learns from its mistakes without needing human input.  

    ii.	Supervised Learning is great for detecting diseases, but farmers need a lot of labeled images.  

    iii.	AI is powerful, but small farms might not afford the technology. 

    Encourage students to respectfully challenge each other’s ideas and ask deeper questions.

#### Activity #2 Name: Identifying Machine Learning Types in Real-World Scenarios (~30 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

Students will be presented with four real-world AI scenarios related to agriculture and everyday technology. Each scenario applies to one of the four types of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, or Transfer Learning). Their task is to analyze the key clues in each scenario and determine which ML type is being used.

1.	The teacher will present four scenarios. Each scenario applies to one of the four types of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, or Transfer Learning).

The student task is to analyze the key clues in each scenario and determine which ML type is being used.

**a. Scenario 1**: **Predicting Apple Ripeness from Sensor Readings**

A commercial apple orchard is working to streamline its harvest and packaging process. Currently, determining apple ripeness requires skilled workers who evaluate apples manually. This is time-consuming, prone to inconsistency, and expensive during peak harvest.

To automate this step, the farm has begun collecting data using non-destructive sensors that measure three traits:

i.	Color score (based on visual hue)

ii.	Sugar content (measured in °Brix)

iii.	Firmness (measured in pressure units)

Alongside these readings, each apple was evaluated by human experts as either “Ripe” or “Unripe.” The farm wants to build an AI model that uses this data to predict ripeness instantly for new apples on the sorting line.  

- Key Clues to Consider: 

    i. The dataset includes a column with labeled outcomes (“Ripe” or “Unripe”).

    ii.	The goal is to predict the label for a new input based on past examples. 

    iii. The AI is expected to learn the relationship between measurable inputs and a specific target.

- Task for Students: 

    i.	Q1: Discuss with your group: What kind of machine learning model would work best here?  

    ii.	Q2: How can past labeled data help the model learn to predict new cases? 

    iii. Q3: How might this help reduce waste or sorting errors during harvest?

b. **Scenario 2: Analyzing Greenhouse Climate Patterns**  

Inside a high-tech greenhouse that grows vegetables year-round, each growing zone is equipped with climate sensors. These sensors track data such as: 

i.	Humidity levels 

ii.	Ambient temperature 

iii.	CO₂ concentration

While all zones are managed independently, the farm hasn’t systematically studied which zones perform similarly or which crops thrive under similar environmental conditions. Management suspects that some zones may have overlapping climate patterns that could be grouped together and optimized. 

Instead of manually analyzing the data, they decide to use AI to group zones by similarity to inform decisions about ventilation, irrigation, and lighting. There are no labels for each zone — only raw environmental readings.

- **Key Clues to Consider:**

    i. There are no target labels in the dataset — just sensor readings. 

    ii.	The goal is to discover patterns or clusters in the data. 

    iii. AI is expected to group zones without being told what the “correct” categories are.

- **Task for Students:** 

    i.	Q1: Which ML approach is best suited for this kind of data and goal?

    ii.	Q2: What might the clusters represent? 

    iii. Q3: How could the farm use these patterns to reduce operational costs or improve crop placement?

c.	**Scenario 3: Improving Performance of a Weeding Robot**  

A vegetable farm deploys an autonomous weeding robot that roams crop rows and removes unwanted plants. Each day, the robot logs: 

i.	How many weeds it removed 

ii.	How much battery it used 

iii.	Its navigation accuracy

Engineers want the robot to become more efficient over time. If it removes more weeds with less battery and greater accuracy, the system should reinforce those strategies. If it performs poorly, the robot should adjust its behavior to avoid repeating mistakes. 

There is no explicit training data or labels—just a record of daily outcomes. The robot must learn through experience and feedback to improve performance.

- Key Clues to Consider: 

    i.	There are no fixed labels telling the robot what to do. 

    ii.	The AI improves by evaluating outcomes of previous actions. 

    iii.	Daily performance feedback helps shape future decisions.

- **Task for Students:**

    i.	Q1: Which ML type enables improvement through experience? 

    ii.	Q2: What metrics might serve as “rewards” or “penalties”? 

    iii.	Q3: How would this system evolve differently than one trained from labeled data?

d.	**Scenario 4: Adapting a Pest Detection Model from Tomatoes to Peppers**  

A tomato farm built a successful AI model that detects pest infestations early by analyzing plant leaf images. The model was trained on thousands of tomato plant examples, using features like: 

i.	Leaf spot density 

ii.	Edge browning percentage

Now, a nearby pepper grower wants to use a similar system but lacks enough data to build a new model from scratch. Instead, they take the tomato model and fine-tune it with a small amount of new data from pepper crops. 

The goal is to apply what the AI already learned to the pepper domain while minimizing the cost and time of data collection.

- **Key Clues to Consider:** 

    i.	The system reuses an existing model from a related domain. 

    ii.	Only a small amount of new data is used to adapt to a similar crop. 

    iii. The focus is on speeding up learning by avoiding full retraining.

- **Task for Students:**

    i.	Q1: What ML technique allows for leveraging prior models in new contexts? 

    ii.	Q2: What risks are involved when adapting a model from one crop to another? 

    iii. Q3: How does this approach reduce development time?

2. To finalize the lesson, the teacher will instruct students to complete the following questions in the **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout**

a.	**Q1: How does Machine Learning help farmers make better decisions?** 

b.	**Q2: Which type of Machine Learning do you think is most useful in farming? Why?**
