## L7 Lesson Plan: Machine Learning in Agriculture

### Lesson Description:
This lesson introduces students to Machine Learning (ML) and its role in agriculture. Students will explore the differences between Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning, analyze real-world AI applications in farming, and work with datasets to understand how AI improves agricultural decision-making.  

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will understand the four types of Machine Learning and apply them to agricultural challenges by analyzing real-world AI farming applications.  

### Essential Question:
How does Machine Learning improve decision-making in agriculture?  

### Standards:
•	Understand the different types of Machine Learning and their applications in agriculture. 

•	Analyze how AI processes farming data to optimize resources and improve efficiency. 

•	Apply Machine Learning principles to real-world farming challenges.

### Objectives:
•	Define and differentiate between Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning. 
•	Explain how AI processes agricultural data for decision-making. 
•	Analyze datasets to determine which ML approach best fits a given farming problem. 
•	Justify the use of different Machine Learning methods in real-world agricultural scenarios.
