## Lesson 7: Machine Learning in Agriculture Learning
### Lesson Description:
This lesson introduces students to Machine Learning (ML) and its role in agriculture. Students will explore the differences between Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning, analyze real-world AI applications in farming, and work with datasets to understand how AI improves agricultural decision-making.    

### Main Learning Goal:
Students will understand the four types of Machine Learning and apply them to agricultural challenges by analyzing real-world AI farming applications.    

### Essential Question:
How does Machine Learning improve decision-making in agriculture?

### Standards:
•	Understand the different types of Machine Learning and their applications in agriculture.  

•	Analyze how AI processes farming data to optimize resources and improve efficiency.  

•	Apply Machine Learning principles to real-world farming challenges.

### Objectives:
•	Define and differentiate between Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning.  

•	Explain how AI processes agricultural data for decision-making.  

•	Analyze datasets to determine which ML approach best fits a given farming problem.  

•	Justify the use of different Machine Learning methods in real-world agricultural scenarios.

### Introduction to Machine Learning 

This lesson revisits the basics of Machine Learning by comparing it to human learning, exploring the four ML types through farming examples, and emphasizing that different tasks require different ML approaches.

### What is Machine Learning? 

Machine Learning is a branch of AI where computers learn from data instead of being programmed with specific instructions.

• Imagine you have a pet dog. If you show your younger siblings a dog and say, 
 “This is a dog,” they will remember the features—it has four legs, fur, a tail, and it barks. Later, if they see another dog, they will recognize it even if it's a different breed. 
This is how humans learn from examples and experiences. 

### Human Learning vs. Machine Learning 

- Humans recognize patterns and adapt quickly based on a few examples. 

- AI, on the other hand, analyzes large amounts of data to find patterns. 

- Think about how we teach a child what a dog looks like—humans need just a few examples, but AI needs thousands of labeled images before it can identify a dog accurately.

The Four Types of Machine Learning (Detailed Explanation) 

ML is not one-size-fits-all—different AI tasks need different ML approaches. 

Let’s explore each type of ML with real-world examples in farming. 

1. Supervised Learning (Guided Learning): 

    - What is it? 

        i.	AI learns from labeled examples (it is “supervised” like a student in class). 

        ii.	AI knows the right answers during training and tries to make predictions. 

    - **How it works:**

        i. AI is given a dataset with correct answers (e.g., a list of plant images labeled “Healthy” or “Sick”). 

        ii.	AI finds patterns between features (color, leaf spots, dryness) and labels. 

        iii. AI is tested with new plant images to see if it can correctly classify them. 

    - **Example in Farming:** 

      AI for Plant Disease Detection 

        i.	AI shows 10,000 images of crops labeled "Healthy" or "Diseased." 

        ii.	AI learns what a sick plant looks like. 

        iii. When given a new plant image, AI predicts if it’s sick or healthy! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:** 

        i. Imagine you are learning math. A teacher shows examples and gives you the correct answers first. 

        ii.	Later, when you solve problems on your own, you apply the patterns you learned! 

2.	**Unsupervised Learning (Self-Discovery)**: 

    - **What is it?** 

        i.	AI is given data without labels—it must find patterns by itself. 

        ii.	AI groups similar things together without knowing what they are. 

    - **How it works:**

        i.	AI looks at many farm images but isn’t told what’s in them. 

        ii.	AI notices similarities (color, shape, size) and groups similar items together. 

        iii. AI can organize and cluster the data even without labels! 

    - **Example in Farming:**

        AI Sorting Crops by Type 

        i.	AI looks at 10,000 crop images (wheat, corn, rice) but has no labels.

        ii.	It groups wheat together, corn together, and rice together based on similarities. 

        iii. Farmers later label the groups, and AI becomes more accurate over time! 

    - Human Learning Analogy: 

        i. Imagine you visit a school cafeteria for the first time. 

        ii.	You notice groups of students sitting together—athletes, musicians, gamers. 

        iii. Even though no one told you, you figured out patterns and grouped them! 

3.	Reinforcement Learning (Trial & Error Learning) 

    - **What is it?** 

        i.	AI learns by trying things, making mistakes, and getting rewards or penalties.

        ii.	AI improves over time by figuring out the best way to achieve a goal. 

    - **How it works:** 

        i.	AI takes an action (e.g., moving a tractor forward). 

        ii.	AI sees if the action was good or bad (avoided or hit an obstacle). 

        iii.	AI adjusts based on rewards (success) or penalties (mistakes). 

    - **Example in Farming:**

        AI for Self-Driving Tractors 

        i.	AI controls a smart tractor moving through a farm. 

        ii.	If AI avoids obstacles → AI gets a reward. 

        iii.	If AI hits an obstacle → AI gets a penalty. 

        iv.	Over time, AI learns the best path to move efficiently! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:**

        i.	When learning to ride a bike, you might fall at first. 

        ii.	After each fall, you adjust your balance until you master riding. 

4. Transfer Learning (Learning from Experience) 

    - **What is it?** 

        i.	AI applies knowledge from one task to a new but similar task. 

        ii.	Saves time because AI doesn’t start from scratch. 

    - **How it works:**

        i.	AI learns to detect plant diseases in wheat. 

        ii.	AI uses the same learning to detect diseases in corn without full retraining. 

        iii.	AI adapts quickly and works efficiently with new crops! 

    - **Example in Farming:** 

        AI for Disease Detection in Multiple Crops 

        i.	AI was trained on wheat disease images.

        ii.	AI can now detect corn diseases with very little new training! 

    - **Human Learning Analogy:** 

         i. If you already know how to ride a scooter, learning to ride a bike is easier! 

        Remember that in Machine Learning, artificial intelligence (AI) learns patterns and makes decisions based on data rather than being explicitly programmed with specific rules.

        Let’s summarize the four types of Machine Learning and how farming uses ML.

- In Supervised Learning, AI learns from labeled examples. Farming uses this type of ML to detect diseases.

- In Unsupervised Learning, AI finds patterns without labels. Farming uses this type of ML to group crops.

- In Reinforcement Learning, AI learns from trial & error. Farming uses this type of ML to optimize irrigation

- In Transfer Learning, AI applies past knowledge to new tasks. Farming uses this type of ML to adapt AI models to new crops.
Now, following along in your **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout** worksheet, answer the following questions:

1.	Q1: How is Supervised Learning similar to how humans learn with a teacher? 

2.	Why might farmers use Unsupervised Learning instead of Supervised Learning?

3.	Q3: How does Reinforcement Learning help AI improve over time?

4.	Q4: Why is Transfer Learning useful for detecting diseases in different crops?

### AI Learning Puzzle- Sort & Solve

Now, we will work in small groups to solve a Machine Learning puzzle by arranging scrambled steps for Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning. We will discuss our reasoning, organize the steps for each ML type, and explain how the sequence helps AI learn effectively.   

Step-by-step Instructions:  

- Each group receives a set of scrambled steps describing how AI learns in Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, and Transfer Learning.

- Sort the steps into what you believe is the correct sequence.  

    - Discuss the reasoning behind their choices:  

        i.	Q1: What clues did they use to arrange the steps?  

        ii.	Q2: How does this order help AI learn properly?  

    - Write down the final order. 

The mission is to arrange the steps in the correct order and explain your reasoning.
Scrambled AI Learning Steps for Students to Organize 

1. Supervised Learning – AI Learns with Labels 

    - AI makes predictions on new plant images based on learned patterns. 

    - AI receives a dataset of labeled plant images ("Healthy" or "Diseased"). 

    - AI compares its predictions with the actual labels and refines its accuracy over time. 

    - AI analyzes patterns (e.g., leaf color, spots, dryness) in the labeled images. 
Clue: This type of learning is like a teacher giving examples before letting students try it on their own. 

2.	Unsupervised Learning – AI Groups Similar Data Without Labels 

    - Farmers review AI-created groups and add meaningful labels (e.g., "high pH," "low moisture"). 
    - AI detects patterns and automatically groups similar soils together. 
    - AI is given thousands of unlabeled soil samples. 
    - AI refines its grouping, making soil classification more accurate over time. 

    **Clue:** AI is not given any answers—it has to find patterns on its own. 

3.	Reinforcement Learning – AI Learns by Trial and Error 

- AI begins controlling an irrigation system with random watering amounts. 
- AI adjusts its watering decisions based on past successes and mistakes. 
- Over time, AI optimizes irrigation schedules for healthier crops. 
- AI receives feedback: If crops are too dry, it gets a penalty; if water is optimal, it gets a reward. 

    **Clue:** This type of learning is like playing a video game—AI gets better by trial and error. 

4.	Transfer Learning – AI Applies Knowledge to a New Problem

- AI is first trained in detecting wheat diseases. 
- AI applies its wheat knowledge to detect corn diseases without full retraining. 
- Farmers now use AI to identify diseases in multiple crops with minimal adjustments. 
- AI is given a small dataset of diseased corn plants to analyze. 

    **Clue:** AI is reusing its knowledge instead of starting from scratch. 

### How AI Helps Farmers

We will understand how AI uses Machine Learning in farming through real-world applications, learn about the data required for each ML method, analyze real datasets.
But first let's start a class discussion of how AI helps farmers considering the following questions.

•	Q1: What are some of the biggest challenges that farmers face?

•	Q2: How do you think AI could help solve these problems?

Engage in the class discussion and share your opinions.

After class discussion, refer to Figure 1 below to visualize how AI could be implemented in a plantation.
 
Figure 1: AI- Powered farm with labeled sensors, drones, and automated irrigation systems.

### How Machine Learning is Used in Farming  
Step-by-Step Explanation of How AI Works in Agriculture 

- Collecting Data – AI uses soil sensors, weather stations, and satellite images to gather information. 

- Processing Data – AI analyzes trends and patterns in data using Machine Learning models. 

- Making Predictions – AI predicts weather changes, crop diseases, and optimal harvest times. 

- Taking Action – AI automatically adjusts irrigation, pest control, or crop schedules based on the analysis. 

    Deep Dive: Machine Learning in Agriculture

Now, let's see how the four machine learning types work in agriculture with datasets.

1. **Supervised Learning – Detecting Plant Diseases** 

**How It Works?**

AI is trained on thousands of images of sick and healthy plants. It learns to identify disease symptoms based on color changes, leaf spots, and dryness. When new plant images are given, the AI can correctly classify them as either healthy or diseased. Refer to Figure 2 and Table 1  
(Dataset Example of Healthy or Diseased) below for an example.
  
Figure 2: Before-and-after AI detection of a diseased plant. 
 
Table 1:  Dataset Example of Health or Diseased

AI Processing Steps:  

- AI analyzes the dataset and learns that yellow or brown leaves with spots are likely diseased. 
- AI scans new plant images and classifies them based on past learning. 
- Farmers use this AI tool on their phones to instantly detect plant diseases in the field. 

2. **Unsupervised Learning – Grouping Crops by Soil Type** 

    **How It Works?**

    AI analyzes soil quality data but isn’t given any pre-set labels. It clusters soil types based on patterns in the data. Farmers then use this clustered data to decide which crops will grow best in different soil types. Refer to Figure 3 and Table 2 (Dataset Example of Cluster Group) below for an example.
 
Figure 3: Color-coded soil map generated by AI. 
 
**Table 2: Dataset Example of Cluster Group
AI Processing Steps:** 

- AI analyzes soil samples based on pH, moisture, and nitrogen levels. 

- AI groups similar soils together into categories (A, B, C). 

- Farmers then plant different crops based on the AI-generated soil category. 
 
3. **Reinforcement Learning – Smart Irrigation Systems** 

    **How It Works?**

     AI adjusts watering schedules based on real-time soil moisture data. If AI over-waters, it learns to reduce water usage. If it under-waters, it corrects its decision for the next cycle. Refer to Figure 4 and Table 3 (Dataset Example of Crop Health Rating) below for an example.
 
**Figure 4: AI-powered irrigation system adjusting water levels.** 
 
**Table 3: Dataset Example of Crop Health Rating**

AI Processing Steps: 

- AI analyzes crop health based on soil moisture and irrigation amount. 

- AI learns from mistakes (overwatering makes plants unhealthy). 

- AI adjusts future irrigation schedules to maximize crop health with minimal water waste. 

4. **Transfer Learning – AI Adapting to Different Crops** 

    **How It Works?** AI that was originally trained to detect diseases in wheat can quickly learn to detect diseases in corn. This saves time because the AI doesn’t need to start from scratch. Refer to Figure 5 and Table 4 (AI Confidence Dataset Example) below for an example.
 
**Figure 5: Two farm regions where AI is re-used across different crops.** 
 
**Table 4: AI Confidence Dataset Example**

AI Processing Steps:

•	AI was trained on wheat diseases first.

•	AI uses this knowledge to detect diseases in corn and other crops.

•	Farmers save time and effort because AI does not need to be retrained from scratch. 

Preparing for the Gallery Walk Poster Activity 

Form small groups and each group is assigned one Machine Learning type.

•	Q1: Definition of their ML type. 


•	Q2: What kind of data does it need? (Labeled, unlabeled, real-time). 

•	Q3: Example of how it helps farmers.

•	Q2: Why is it important in agriculture?

Later, the teacher will wrap up the lesson and you will think and provide your answers to the next question.

•	Q1: Which Machine Learning type do you think is the most useful in farming, and why?

### AI Concepts in Agriculture

This session will introduce key AI concepts and their applications in farming. The focus will be on making these topics engaging and easy to understand through real-world agricultural examples. Then, we will actively participate in a recap discussion to reinforce our understanding of AI's role in improving farming practices.

- What is an Algorithm? 

    - Definition: 

      An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions that AI follows to solve a problem. It tells AI what to do and in what order. 

- Real-World Example: 

    Think about baking a cake—you follow specific steps in order: 

    i.	Gather ingredients 

    ii.	Mix the batter 

    iii.	Bake at the right temperature 

    iv.	Let it cool before eating 

If the steps are out of order (like baking before mixing!), the cake will be ruined. AI works the same way—it needs precise instructions to function correctly. 

- **Farming Example:** 

  AI detecting plant diseases follows an algorithm: 

    i.	Capture an image of the plant 

    ii.	Analyze for signs of disease (yellow leaves, brown spots, etc.) 

    iii. Compare the signs to known plant diseases 

    iv.	Recommend treatment to the farmer

In the **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout**, answer the following: Q1: What type of Machine Learning is being used in this case? Why?

- **What is Sequence & Iteration in AI?**

- Definition: 

    - Sequence = The order of steps AI follows. 

    - Iteration = AI repeats tasks, learning from past actions to improve. 

- **Real-World Example:** 

    Imagine a farmer’s daily routine: 

    i.	Check soil moisture 

    ii.	Water crops if needed 

    iii. Check for pests 

    iv.	Harvest crops 

    If these steps aren’t done in sequence, problems may arise (e.g., watering before checking soil moisture might waste water).

- **Farming Example:** 

    AI learning to irrigate a farm uses iteration: 

    i.	Day 1: AI waters too much, crops are flooded. 

    ii.	Day 2: AI adjusts and waters a little less. 

    iii.	Day 3: AI finds the perfect amount of water for healthy crops.

    **Key Learning:** AI repeats actions to improve over time—just like farmers learn from experience! 

- **What is The Data Processing Cycle?**

- Definition: 

    - AI follows a cycle to analyze data and make smart decisions: 

    - Collect Data → Process Data → Analyze Data → Make a Decision 

- Real-World Example: 

  Imagine a weather app predicting rain: 

    i.	Collect: AI gathers temperature, humidity, and wind speed data. 

    ii.	Process: It cleans the data (removing incorrect readings). 

    iii.	Analyze: AI finds patterns—higher humidity + dark clouds = rain is likely. 

    iv.	Decision: The app alerts users to carry an umbrella. 

- **Farming Example:** 

    An AI-powered irrigation system follows the same cycle: 

    i.	Collect: Sensors measure soil moisture and temperature. 

    ii.	Process: AI removes outlier data (e.g., faulty readings). 

    iii. Analyze: AI checks if soil is dry and compares it to past data.

    iv.	Decision: If soil moisture is below 30%, AI activates irrigation. 

- **What are The Conditionals in AI (If-Then Decisions)?**

- Definition: 

    - AI makes IF-THEN decisions, just like humans! 

- **Real-World Example:**

    i.	IF it rains, THEN bring an umbrella.

    ii.	IF it’s cold, THEN wear a jacket.  

- **Farming Example:**

    Farmers make IF-THEN decisions every day: 

    i.	IF soil moisture is below 30%, THEN water the plants. 

    ii.	IF a plant has yellow spots, THEN AI suggests adding nutrients. 
    Why is this important? 

    AI automates farming by following these rules. Instead of farmers manually checking each plant, AI monitors everything and alerts farmers when action is needed. 

- **What is Pattern Recognition in AI**

- Definition: 

    AI learns by finding patterns in large amounts of data. 

- **Real-World Example:** 

    **Spotify & Netflix recommendations:** 

    i.	If you listen to pop music, Spotify suggests similar songs. 

    ii.	If you watch action movies, Netflix recommends more action films. 

- **Farming Example:** 

    AI analyzing plant diseases follows this process: 

    i.	It studies thousands of plant images (healthy vs. diseased). 

    ii.	It finds patterns (yellow leaves, brown spots = disease). 

    iii.	It applies this knowledge to new plants to detect disease. 

### Why is this important? 

Instead of farmers inspecting every plant manually, AI quickly scans fields and finds diseases faster! 

- **What is Bias in AI Models?** 

- Definition: 

    - AI can be biased if it only learns from limited data. 

- **Real-World Example:** 

  Imagine training a self-driving car only in sunny weather.  

    i. The car might fail in the rain because it never learned about wet roads! 

- **Farming Example:**

    If an AI disease detection model is only trained on wheat crops, it might: 

    i.	Accurately detect wheat diseases. 

    ii.	Misdiagnose diseases in corn or soybeans. 

    **How do we fix AI bias?**

    i.	Use diverse data (train AI on many crops, not just wheat). 

    ii.	Test AI models in different farm conditions (different weather, soil types).
    
    iii.	Farmers should double-check AI results before making big decisions. 

### Discussion About the New Key Concepts

### Identifying Machine Learning Types in Real-World Scenarios 

We will be presented with four real-world AI scenarios related to agriculture and everyday technology. Each scenario applies to one of the four types of Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, or Transfer Learning). Our task is to analyze the key clues in each scenario and determine which ML type is being used.

a. **Scenario 1: Predicting Apple Ripeness from Sensor Readings**   

A commercial apple orchard is working to streamline its harvest and packaging process. Currently, determining apple ripeness requires skilled workers who evaluate apples manually. This is time-consuming, prone to inconsistency, and expensive during peak harvest.

To automate this step, the farm has begun collecting data using non-destructive sensors that measure three traits:

i.	Color score (based on visual hue)

ii.	Sugar content (measured in °Brix)

iii.	Firmness (measured in pressure units)

Alongside these readings, each apple was evaluated by human experts as either “Ripe” or “Unripe.” The farm wants to build an AI model that uses this data to predict ripeness instantly for new apples on the sorting line.   

- Key Clues to Consider: 

    i. The dataset includes a column with labeled outcomes (“Ripe” or “Unripe”).

    ii.	The goal is to predict the label for a new input based on past examples.

    iii. The AI is expected to learn the relationship between measurable inputs and a specific target.

- Task for Students: 

    i.	Q1: Discuss with your group: What kind of machine learning model would work best here?  

    ii.	Q2: How can past labeled data help the model learn to predict new cases?
    
    iii.	Q3: How might this help reduce waste or sorting errors during harvest?

b.	**Scenario 2: Analyzing Greenhouse Climate Patterns**

Inside a high-tech greenhouse that grows vegetables year-round, each growing zone is equipped with climate sensors. These sensors track data such as:  

i.	Humidity levels  

ii.	Ambient temperature  

iii. CO₂ concentration

While all zones are managed independently, the farm hasn’t systematically studied which zones perform similarly or which crops thrive under similar environmental conditions. Management suspects that some zones may have overlapping climate patterns that could be grouped together and optimized. 

Instead of manually analyzing the data, they decide to use AI to group zones by similarity to inform decisions about ventilation, irrigation, and lighting. There are no labels for each zone — only raw environmental readings.

- Key Clues to Consider: 

    i.	There are no target labels in the dataset — just sensor readings. 

    ii.	The goal is to discover patterns or clusters in the data.  

    iii.	AI is expected to group zones without being told what the “correct” categories are.

- Task for Students: 

    i.	Q1: Which ML approach is best suited for this kind of data and goal? 

    ii.	Q2: What might the clusters represent? 

    iii.	Q3: How could the farm use these patterns to reduce operational costs or improve crop placement?

c.	**Scenario 3: Improving Performance of a Weeding Robot**

A vegetable farm deploys an autonomous weeding robot that roams crop rows and removes unwanted plants. Each day, the robot logs: 

i.	How many weeds it removed 

ii.	How much battery it used 

iii. Its navigation accuracy

Engineers want the robot to become more efficient over time. If it removes more weeds with less battery and greater accuracy, the system should reinforce those strategies. If it performs poorly, the robot should adjust its behavior to avoid repeating mistakes.

There is no explicit training data or labels—just a record of daily outcomes. The robot must learn through experience and feedback to improve performance.

- Key Clues to Consider: 

    i.	There are no fixed labels telling the robot what to do.  

    ii.	The AI improves by evaluating outcomes of previous actions.  

    iii.	Daily performance feedback helps shape future decisions.

- Task for Students: 

    i.	Q1: Which ML type enables improvement through experience?  

    ii.	Q2: What metrics might serve as “rewards” or “penalties”?  

    iii.	Q3: How would this system evolve differently than one trained from labeled data?

d.	**Scenario 4: Adapting a Pest Detection Model from Tomatoes to Peppers**  

A tomato farm built a successful AI model that detects pest infestations early by analyzing plant leaf images. The model was trained on thousands of tomato plant examples, using features like:  

i.	Leaf spot density 

ii.	Edge browning percentage

Now, a nearby pepper grower wants to use a similar system but lacks enough data to build a new model from scratch. Instead, they take the tomato model and fine-tune it with a small amount of new data from pepper crops. 

The goal is to apply what the AI already learned to the pepper domain while minimizing the cost and time of data collection.

- Key Clues to Consider:

    i.	The system reuses an existing model from a related domain.  

    ii.	Only a small amount of new data is used to adapt to a similar crop. 

    iii.	The focus is on speeding up learning by avoiding full retraining.

- Task for Students: 

    i.	Q1: What ML technique allows for leveraging prior models in new contexts? 

    ii.	Q2: What risks are involved when adapting a model from one crop to another? 

    iii.	Q3: How does this approach reduce development time?

Finally, let’s take a look at our **SREB_U3_L7 _Handout**. Now that we have a better understanding of how different types of machine learning can assist in farming, let’s consider the following questions:

1.	**Q1: How does Machine Learning help farmers make better decisions?**  

2.	**Q2: Which type of Machine Learning do you think is most useful in farming? Why?**
