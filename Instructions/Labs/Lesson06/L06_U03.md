#### Introduction to Agricultural Sensors
This lesson will explore how hardware components – including sensors, microcontrollers, circuits, and motors – are used in AI-powered agricultural systems. We will examine how these elements work together to collect environmental data and control outputs through automated decision-making processes.

Sensors collect real-time data from the environment and serve as the primary input into automated decision-making systems. These sensors are essential for collecting data that AI systems use to make informed decisions.

Examples of sensors commonly used in agriculture: 

- Soil Moisture Sensors: 

    - Purpose: Monitor soil water content.

    - Application: Optimizing irrigation schedules, preventing overwatering, conserving water resources. 

- Temperature Sensors: 

    - Purpose: Track temperature variations. 

    - Application: Managing greenhouse environments, preventing crop damage due to frost or overheating. 

- Humidity Sensors: 

    - Purpose: Measure the moisture content in the air. 

    - Application: Ensuring ideal growth conditions in greenhouses or storage facilities. 

- Light Sensors (Photoresistors): 

    - Purpose: Detect light intensity. 

    - Application: Automating lighting systems in greenhouses, optimizing plant growth. 

- Proximity Sensors: 

    - Purpose: Detect the presence or absence of objects. 

    - Application: Automation in machinery operations, collision avoidance in autonomous farm vehicles. 

- pH Sensors: 

    - Purpose: Measure soil acidity or alkalinity. 

    - Application: Ensuring optimal soil conditions for different crops, guiding fertilizer applications. 

- Nutrient Sensors: 

    - Purpose: Assess levels of essential soil nutrients. 
    - Application: Precision farming techniques, targeted nutrient management, reducing waste and costs. 


### What are Microcontrollers?
Integrating microcontrollers with these sensors enables precise, efficient, and automated agricultural practices, significantly improving crop yields and resource management. 

**But what are microcontrollers?**

Microcontrollers are compact computers embedded into machines to control specific tasks. In smart agriculture, they are used to process information received from environmental sensors. 

For example, a soil moisture sensor sends an electrical signal to the microcontroller, which compares the signal to a programmed moisture threshold. If the soil is too dry, the microcontroller sends a command to activate an irrigation pump. If the soil has enough moisture, the system does nothing. This automated process happens continuously, allowing farms to conserve water and maintain ideal growing conditions without constant human input. 

Microcontrollers are essential for enabling responsive and data-driven decision-making in real-time farming environments. Commonly used microcontrollers include Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and ESP32, each offering ease of use and versatility in agricultural applications.

There are four key components when it comes to the microcontroller:

- Sensors: Detect environmental changes.
- Microcontroller: Makes the decision.
- Circuit: Transmits power and data.
- Motor/Actuator: Executes the output (e.g., opens a valve)

In your **SREB_U3_L6_Handout**

Match each sensor below to its description. Then, sketch a small icon or image of what it might look like.

Sensor Type	What It Measures	Sketch

Soil Moisture Sensor	___________________________________

Then, pair up with a classmate to discuss your answers.

#### AI Integration in Agriculture

Now that we have explored the hardware behind AI systems, we will next try to understand how AI integrates with microcontrollers and sensors in agriculture to enhance data analysis, decision-making, and real-time monitoring, with examples like smart irrigation and crop monitoring drones.

You’ll watch a few short video clips that show how AI is already being used in agriculture through robots, drones, and smart machines. While you watch, take notes on what each system is sensing, what action it takes, and how the different parts of the system work together.

What Is Precision Agriculture? (Vedio)


Now, let’s discuss what we have observed after watching the videos.

1.	What is the system sensing?  
2.	What action is it taking?  
3.	How do the components communicate?

#### Input-Processing-Output (I-P-O) Cycle
Now that you’ve seen smart farming technology in action, it’s time to break down how these systems actually work using the **Input → Processing → Output** model.

You will go through an example on the board showing:

**Sensor (Input) → Microcontroller (Processing) → Motor/Device (Output)**

Then, you’ll complete your own version in the SREB_U3_L6_Handout.docx  . Your diagram should include:

- Sensor(s) collecting data
- Microcontroller processing that data
- Action/Output triggered based on decisions


### AI System Scenario Analysis

Let’s take a closer look at some real-world AI-powered agricultural systems. Consider the following examples of AI applications in agriculture: 

- Smart Irrigation: AI algorithms analyze soil moisture sensor data, historical weather data, and real-time forecasts to precisely automate watering schedules, conserving water, and maintaining optimal plant hydration. 
- Autonomous Farm Vehicles: Using proximity sensors and GPS data, AI-driven smart tractors and robots navigate fields autonomously, performing tasks such as planting, fertilizing, harvesting, and weed control with remarkable accuracy. 
- Crop Monitoring Drones: Equipped with advanced camera sensors and AI-driven image analysis, drones detect early signs of crop stress, pest infestations, or nutrient deficiencies, allowing timely intervention and reduced crop losses. 
- Precision Nutrient Management: Nutrient sensors combined with AI algorithms optimize fertilizer application, significantly improving crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts and reducing costs.

As a class, let’s complete a flowchart with one of the examples we have just discussed, identifying and labelling:

- Input (sensors)
- Processing (microcontroller logic) 
- Output (system response)

Now, in your **SREB_U3_L6_Handout.docx**   choose one real-world AI system that has been discussed, and complete the following:

- Sketch the system and label the hardware
- Show the I-P-O flow
- Identify one benefit and one challenge of using this technology



**My Chosen AI System:** ________________________________

- One benefit and one challenge

#### Exit Ticket
To close, let’s complete a short reflection.
You’ll choose one technology and describe:

1.	What it senses (input).
2.	What it does with the data (processing).
3.	What action happens (output).

Then, you’ll draw a simple visual to go along with your explanation.

#### AI on the Farm
To finish up this lesson, take some time to think about everything you’ve learned about AI systems in agriculture, and how all the pieces (sensors, microcontrollers, and motors) work together using the input-processing-output (I-P-O) cycle.
Consider the following questions:

1.	**What was the most surprising technology you saw in today's lesson?**
2.	**How does the I-P-O cycle help a system make decisions without human input?**
3.	**Which component (sensor, microcontroller, or motor) do you think is most important, and why? (You will answer this in your handout).**

#### Exit Ticket
To wrap everything up, you’ll complete a short individual written reflection. You’ll pick o**ne AI system** (like smart irrigation, a crop-scanning drone, or an automated 
tractor) and break it down into three parts:

1.	**Input:** What data is collected? 
2.	**Processing:** What is the system doing with that data?  
3.	**Output:** What action happens as a result?
