#### Activity #2 Name: How Microcontrollers Use Sensor Data (~15 minutes)

**Activity Walkthrough:**

1.	The teacher will explain what Microcontrollers are and how do they work.

    a. Microcontrollers are compact computers embedded into machines to control specific tasks. In smart agriculture, they are used to process information received from environmental sensors. For example, a soil moisture sensor sends an electrical signal to the microcontroller, which compares the signal to a programmed moisture threshold. If the soil is too dry, the microcontroller sends a command to activate an irrigation pump. If the soil has enough moisture, the system does nothing. This automated process happens continuously, allowing farms to conserve water and maintain ideal growing conditions without constant human input. Microcontrollers are essential for enabling responsive and data-driven decision-making in real-time farming environments.

    i. Identify key components in the system and what roles they play:

    1. Sensors: Detect environmental changes
    2.	Microcontroller: Makes the decision
    3.	Circuit: Transmits power and data
    4.	Motor/Actuator: Executes the output (e.g., opens a valve)

    b.	In their **SREB_U3_L6_Handout**, students will match each sensor to their description and sketch a small icon or image of what it might look like.
